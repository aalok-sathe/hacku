Vehicle manufacturers have torque specification for lug nuts which these guys in their inexperience and lack of knowledge ignored. Not going back. Ever.")

I got the traditional Benny which came out to be so delicious. I checked in on yelp and got a free banana muffin which also was delicious! It wasn't dry or nasty. It was perfect. They also have a cute idea of flipping over a plastic egg to a sad face when you need something. We needed some extra tortillas and flipped our egg to a sad face and they came immediately. My plate came with a side of potatoes which tasted amazing. I'm so glad I gave this place a try! Open to trying new places now.")

I need this in my life every day!\" Food and service was top notch. Don't call anyone else, hands down, this is the Mexican food you need for your next event.")
