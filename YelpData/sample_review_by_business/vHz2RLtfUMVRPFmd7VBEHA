So we were pretty excited to get a reservation! Protip: Make a reservation. It's still pretty new so there's a lot of hype and a long wait. Luckily Open Table found us an earlier dinner time. We were seated promptly. So cool to see the Hells Kitchen theme throughout the restaurant. Looking at the menu, any Gordon fan would be pleased with the selection of his signature dishes.. Naturally we had to get them all! We got the prix fixe menu and started with seared scallops but of course we needed lobster risotto too. Both were cooked well though the lobster tail was small and scallops were a bit \"short\" and one was a little burnt. Then we got the braised beef short rib and beef wellington. The short rib was good but the Wellie stole the show! The filet was cooked perfectly. The pastry was puffy and stuffed with all the signature fillings. Delish! We got a side of Mac cheese which was amazing. We also got a side of Brussel Sprouts, which were good but the sweet chili sauce was unexpected and didn't really match the rest of our meal. Then we finished it off with the sticky toffee pudding which was amazing though very rich! Definitely a great experience!

The risotto was extremely flavorful, the beef Wellington was amazing! It was probably the most tender, softest piece of meat I've ever eaten, and the sauce that went with it was bomb.

On the table was: a couple of beef Wellingtons, a few orders of scallops, salmons, short rib, lamb rack, a filet, mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, a lobster risotto, and tuna tartare. \n\nI ordered the tuna tartare as an app, salmon as an entree with Brussel sprouts as my side. I didn't enjoy the tuna tartare at all. It made it really spicy. And I didn't like his \"Asian\" twist on it. I'm sure it was a sweet chili sauce. It just didn't go well with ahi tuna. So then, the salmon. It was really really good! The crispy skin made the dish exceptionally good as well as the lemon beurre bland. The Brussels sprouts were also a favorite. It was seasoned really well! And the mushrooms were really good and plentiful, I had a few spoonful of my cousins and she still had a lot to share with the group. The Wellington was a little bland. But I've never had a beef Wellington before so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like. The lamb rack was amazing. Seasoned well, cooked to perfection. I'm not a fan of short rib, but the person who ordered it had nothing but good things to say. And the sticky toffee pudding was really good! I was only able to get a few bites in as it was really sweet. \n\nSO the reason for the 3 stars was the service! It was a 2-3 stars in service. I get it, were a group of 9 who weren't all going to spend 100s of dollars for the table because none of us really wanted to drink and only half of us got appetizers, BUT that's still not an excuse to be rude. Two of the members of the party had prior obligations and so they were only going to order sides because they had already eaten, but still wanted to celebrate with us... and the server told them, if they weren't going to order entrees, that's why they have a bar. As a server, part of your job is hospitality and that is no way to treat someone who is going to give you money at the end of the day. There definitely could've been a better way to relay that information.  And so that couple ended up ordering a steak and scallops, but he doubled up their scallops to equate to an entree??? Okay.\n\nThen two of the members left early but I still had their money for the bill, so I asked if we can split the bill, which 4 ways max, very reasonable. But I asked for a bill for the two who left early so I can give the guy an itemized receipt with whatever left over money he had, to which he rudely asked we'll where are they? Uhhhm. Okay.\n\nTheir reservation system is also pretty whack. You check in for a table, then stand in a line for another thirty minutes. I don't understand the point of time slots for reservations if they're going to sit us 20-30 minutes late. \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't come back nor recommend. I was just very turned off by the servers demeanor towards the party. Which we don't make reservations months in advance to celebrate a birthday just to be treated badly.","date":"2018-04-27 19:50:13"}

I'm not talking about the screaming font of clever vulgarity (though that is f%#$ing entertaining), but the Gordon Ramsay you find in his cookbooks and recipe videos, the more genteel and encouraging teacher of the culinary arts.  But as big of a fan as I am, I'd never had the chance to dine at one of his restaurants.  You can imagine my excitement when we were lucky enough to score a table at his newest Vegas venture, Hell's Kitchen at Caesar's Palace.\n\nHell's Kitchen is in a stand-alone building right on Las Vegas Boulevard, with a large metallic pitchfork bearing the restaurant's logo out front, and deep red signage.\n\nUpon entering, you're greeted to a spacious interior, replete with pitchfork fixtures and an open kitchen split into red and blue halves, the crew on each side dressed in matching smocks and bandannas.  The flaming mosaic work above the kitchen follows this motif.  It's quite a nice place to look at, the only misfire being the video screen right inside the door with Ramsay walking off and on camera to deliver some PG-rated quotes about the place.  \n\nThe dining room is wide open, with tables spaced liberally throughout.  The service is impeccable, with friendly and knowledgeable staff who strike the right balance between check-ins, banter, and leaving you alone to enjoy your food.\n\nThe cocktails are all very good, offering takes on a Pimm's cup, fruity quaffables with dry ice, and even a  drink delivered in a smoking box.  \n\nThe menu reads like a Ramsay's Greatest Hits, with scallops, Beef Wellington, and toffee pudding, the three actually comprising the pre fixe menus, which is the best deal on the menu.  We did try a seafood tower which was, well, a seafood tower.  Nothing exceedingly special, but a nice selection of seafood.  My special ladyfriend had the quinoa salad.  Never would I have imagined that it'd be one of the best things on the menu, but it is legitimately good, and I was more than happy to help her finish it off.\n\nThe special ladyfriend had the chicken, and it is transiently spicy and very good, with a bed of hearty hash that has a sweet crunch to it.\n\nThe rest of us had the Beef Wellington.  One thing I've always taken issue with is Ramsay's affection for the filet, which I think is the most overrated cut of beef out there.  The thing has no marbling, uniform texture.  It's just not as interesting as the ribeye in my book.  But, then again, I'd never had filet Ramsay style.  The delicate pastry crust, the savory mushroom pate, a perfectly-cooked rare filet... this isn't just the best thing I ate last night... it was arguably the best thing I have ever eaten.\n\nIt's clear that the kitchen has extreme confidence in the Wellington, because they don't even bother to equip you with anything more than the butter knife that is already on the table.  And that knife slices through it like it were a razor blade.\n\nHell's Kitchen is not excessively pricey for Las Vegas, which makes it all the easier to recommend.  Without a doubt, if you're fortunate enough to find an open reservation slot, take it.  Absolutely superb, and highly recommended.","date":"2018-02-11 03:50:15"}

I had never been in the restaurant so I felt so awkward walking around people who were eatting. \n\nAfter finding my friends there was long wait between shift change of servers. Causing a huge delay between my entrees and my friends entrees coming out. The new server was this creepy, overly tan, John Stamos Homeless looking man. Who made the most uncomfortable comments to me and my friends. For example he dropped my spoon and picked it up and said \" I needs to lay off the crack\" . Then returned with the new one and proceeded to touch my friend's hair to see what her tattoo on her back looked like, It was aweful. Not to mention the silverware was spotty with food still attached to it. The glasswear had hard water stains, yucky.\n\nAs far as our food went I ordered the beef wellington which was amazing!

But when my sister-in-law informed us that it had, none of us could pass up the opportunity. As long-standing dorks about the show, we were excited to get the chance to dine in a spot that Ramsay had cultivated in large part just for fans. We opted to go for lunch since it was a much more affordable way to participate in the experience. I must say that it sure delivered on fulfilling our dorky expectations. Ramsay has a knack for Vegas, and it shines in full force here.\n\nThe entire restaurant is staged to appeal to fans of the show. The exterior strongly resembles the restaurant in the show; they have a video recorded Gordon to greet you at the entrance; and the kitchen is visually split between red and blue \"teams,\" even if you know they are not actually competing. The host staff is all dressed in red with Hell's Kitchen pins, and the wait staff is extremely polite, knowledgable, and professional. \n\nWe sat at a high-top table near the bar, which gave us a great view of all the action. Our waiter walked us through the menu, including sharing with us the fun and exciting food and drink specials. I couldn't help ordering the special cocktail (Smoke on the Boulevard) that tasted like a Manhattan but was served in a smoke-filled cage, giving it a hint of fire. We also tried the Note from Gordon, which was delicious and came with a cute, rolled-up \"note\" with a quote from the show. \n\nWe tried quite a variety of the food on the menu between the three of us. My sister-in-law ordered the prix-fixe menu so that she would get to try her most desired dish--the beef wellington. She also opted for the wine pairing, and was very happy with everything she was served. My husband and I ordered off the standard menu. He got the scallops as an appetizer, and I chose the quinoa salad. The scallops were good but honestly were not as perfect as we might have hoped. In contrast, the quinoa salad was unexpectedly fresh and delicious, and ended up being one of the all-around favorite dishes of the day. My husband selected the salmon as an entree, which was beautiful and received positive reviews from the carnivores. I had fewer choices as a vegetarian, so I selected the wild mushroom pizza. My husband loved it and, since I was getting full, did a great deal to help me finish. For my taste, I felt that it was very, very fresh but possibly missing something. In their defense, however, I have a feeling that my waiter may have misheard my \"vegetarian\" as \"vegan\" and instructed the chefs to keep off the gouda. I sure didn't taste any on there. But even with what I did receive, the meal was very tasty. We all shared the sticky toffee pudding and it was delicious, though it was so huge that I'm not sure how anyone can eat it alone--we had trouble finishing it between the three of us. \n\nOverall, we had a really fun experience at Hell's Kitchen, and it delivered all of the kitsch and fun that we hoped it would. The meal wasn't perfect, but it was delicious, and I have no regrets. On the contrary, we had a blast, and it was such a fun experience to go. Definitely a playful, enjoyable opportunity for fans of the show.","date":"2018-04-04 04:23:06"}

From the minute we walked in we were in heaven. We love the Vegas dining scene and appreciate a great meal. We originally had a dinner reservation but our plans changed and we did lunch. The menu covers all desires and very well thought out. We had a group of 8 and a very nice bottle of wine, what a nice Friday!!! We ordered various appetizers, scallops, lobster risotto and wafts meatballs all fantastic!!! As far as entrees we went all over the board- seafood tower, short ribs, hell' burger, brick chicken grilled cheese and one ordered the preset 3 course meal. Everything was as advertised! The favorites were the short ribs, hell burger and brick chicken. We rallied for dessert and went with the insanely cool and delicious pineapple dry ice creation- so good!! We have had the toffee pudding and Ramsay steak but this was a different ice cream and presentation. Overall very well done mr Ramsay!!! Our server John and assistant Margarita were off the charts hospitable. Every detail addressed and so attentive.

Let me first start off by complimenting the staff from the hostess to the server...BRILLIANT as Chef Ramsay would say ha! I came to Vegas on a Monday last week with my fiancée and stayed until Thursday, I knew I wanted to check this place out because I love the show and have tried his other restaurants in Vegas which is a MUST to check out as well. I messaged the business through Yelp and didn't really expect a response but got one from a World class man by the name of Louie which is the manager. He responded right away and we exchanged messages in a timely manner and asked if I wanted him to put me and my fiancée names down for a reservation. I wasn't really sure what day I wanted cause I wanted to surprise her. Well let's just say I lagged a little and when I tried to book through the website it was full. I was sad but thanks to Louie he actually put me down on the last day before we were leaving Vegas. My fiancée was so excited and when we got there sure enough we were on the list! We got sat right away by the lovely hostess. That's the kind of manager that can make a difference and keep customers coming back. He didn't have to do any of that even if it was a small gesture it meant the WORLD to me and my fiancée and is SO appreciated. I won't forget to mention OTT (yeah you know me)! If you have the good fortune to get this man wait your table then consider yourself a winner in Vegas even if you don't gamble. From the moment we sat down this guy was nothing but class and it felt like I was on a culinary experience tour. He answered all of our questions and educated us on every part of our meal. The food doesn't need any reviewing because let's face it your eating at Gordon Ramsays and EVERYTHING that I've had coming from the brilliance of this man has been nothing less than DELICIOUS. I wanted this review to be about my experience with the staff because without people like them then it wouldn't be so memorable and they deserve praise for what they do on a daily basis. It's not easy working with the public in high volume and ESPECIALLY when they're hungry. Oh and shot out to my Chefs' who made our DELICIOUS food! THANK YOU ALL!","date":"2018-04-04 06:54:57"}

This review reflects the food, service, and restaurant appearance. \n\nWe made our lunch reservations online and showed up about an hour early with the absence of anticipated traffic.   To our delight, we were accommodated despite showing up early and having every table almost filled with patrons.  \n\nWe were greeted by the hostess who seated us and later on by our waiter Garvin.  Throughout the meal, the service was friendly, positive, and pleasant. Garvin even remembered all our names during the service.  \n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes on the lunch menu. Appetizers included the pan seared scallops which were cooked and presented perfectly, and the lobster risotto which my daughter enjoyed.  This is saying a lot as she is normally very picky about what she eats.\n\nThe entrees included a mushroom pizza, a chicken burger, eggs purgatory (breakfast eggs in a spicy tomato sauce) and we also ordered from the prefixed menu.\n\nThe PF menu included\n1. a caesars salad plated nicely with croutons, Parmesan cheese crunchy bites, and had no old pieces of salad in it (thankfully!)\n2. The beef Wellington cooked medium rare and literally melts in your mouth being so tender\n3. Sticky toffee pudding topped with ice cream\n\nThe only dish that missed its mark was the eggs purgatory which had egg shells in it inadvertently.\n\nLastly the restaurant, entrance lobby, and restrooms were clean.  \n\nOverall I would give our experience a 4.5 stars however Yelp does not have the option.\n\nWe would gladly return again as it was a positive experience based on the food and service.","date":"2018-07-08 01:43:49"}

The BEST table, right in front of the kitchen where the 2 teams \"compete\". Let me tell you the place is gorgeous and I wouldn't expect anything less but the staple of the restaurant is getting to watch them cook, the people expediting actually pushing back plates and telling the chefs to cook it again, make it perfect, exactly how ramsey would tell his team. We all got the lunch priced 3 course meal: soup or salad, half a wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. I also added the lobster risotto to my meal because I couldn't resist. Everything tasted incredible, words can't do it justice.. you just need to try the place for yourself. Everything was flavorful and presented beautifully! My only teeny tiny thing is that I wish there was more ice cream to toffee pudding ratio, give me just a little more ice cream please !

It was supposed to be the highlight to my daughter's  21st birthday.\n\nGordon Ramsay would say about his own staff serving cold food, \"IT'S COLD YOU ARSE!\" (slams plate on the floor or smashes it against the chef's chest).  This is primarily what I remember along with SERVING APPETIZERS BEFORE THE ENTREE!!!!  I can hear Gordon now, \"GET OUT OF MY KITCHEN YOU FOOL!  GET OUT NOW!   WHY ARE YOU STILL STANDING THERE?!  Beef Wellington was ok with the exception of it being COLD!  Crispy skinned salmon was prepared well, nicely seasoned and moist.  Too bad it was cold.  The only thing that was not cold because the chefs probably waited until it was done, was the charcuterie pizza.  Nice and crispy crust with lots of meat and a full onslaught of prosciutto on top.  By far the hottest entree, if you will.\n\nOK, now on to the appetizers. Yes you are not misreading this...the appetizers came out after the entrees were served!  Pan seared scallops would have been delectable if they weren't COLD!  Lobster risotto was very good with lots of lobster laid on top of the risotto was, I imagine, fantastic with the exception of being....C.O.L.D.  \n\nMoving on to desserts.  Sticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream.  Delicious cake like...and it's hot!  \n\nGordon, if you are reading these reviews, tell your staff to get it together or GET OUT! If you are paying your chef $250,000, they need to do better. If you're in hell, everything has got to be hot!  This time NOT!

It's definitely much more fun coming here if you're a fan of Gordon Ramsay and have watched any of his shows and\/or YouTube videos.\n\nWe parked in the underground parking lot at Caesar's Palace, which is free the first hour and $12 for 1-4 hours, and walked about 10 minutes through the hotel\/casino to the restaurant. We had reservations for an 11:30am lunch on a Sunday, which was necessary since the restaurant started getting really busy around noon. They were also booked for the entirety of dinner that night, so I'd recommend making reservations as early as possible! We asked to sit in the main section of the restaurant because you can get the best view of the restaurant kitchen, which is similar to the kitchen on the show's set.\n\nWe started off with the $19 Tuna Tartare (delicious and good to share between 2-3 people) and the $16 Red Quinoa Salad (I wish I could eat it everyday). Then we had the $34 Braised Short Rib and a separate order of the Beef Wellington (around ~$50 for 6 oz.) compared to the 3-course lunch special, which only offers 3 oz. of beef wellington.\n\nThe Braised Short Rib was extremely tender, and even though it wasn't as flavorful as I thought it'd be, it combined so well with the rest of the ingredients of the dish: creamy polenta, baby vegetables, and beef jus. I can't really describe how, but this combination created a very very satisfying dish. I recommend ordering this and sharing it between two people on top of another entree!\n\nThe Beef Wellington was a bit disappointing, especially after drooling from watching videos of Gordon Ramsay making it. I felt like the beef was a tad bit dry and the puff pastry didn't actually add that much to the taste, which made the dish not as memorable or satisfying as the Braised Short Rib. It was also an appetizer-more expensive than the Braised Short Rib!\n\nService was great by the way, and our waiter convinced us to try the $9 Pineapple Carpaccio, a light, fruity dessert with a unique presentation consisting of dry ice and vapor (highly recommended for the novelty of the dessert!).\n\nNOTE: Although the Beef Wellington was a bit disappointing, there was only one downside of the meal: bottled water. When asked if we wanted house or bottled water, I absentmindedly chose bottled water, only to find at the end of the meal that bottled water costs $8 (EIGHT DOLLARS!!!) per bottle. C'mon Gordon, just keep it simple and only offer free house water, which is probably the same as the bottled water anyway. This isn't Europe.\n\nUltimately, I still recommend checking out Hell's Kitchen, not just for the great food, but also just for a fun, satisfying experience at one of the best-in-the-world celebrity chef's restaurants!","date":"2018-09-03 06:37:14"}

He has been a long time fan of the series. We wanted to do something special for his birthday. I made reservations for 10 people even before the restaurant was open. I explained the situation to the host via phone and asked her if there would be anyway the head chef (season 10 winner) could come by our table to say \"hi\" to our son. She made a note on our reservation. I called several times to remind them (including the night before). They gave me the impression that it was a done deal. We drove from California only to find out that the head chef left \"earlier\" that day. Needless to say we were extremely disappointed. Especially considering that we spent approximately 1000 dollars for our table. The management did nothing to help. Not even a t shirt as a consolation.\n\nUpdate (23 February 2018) - Please Read! - After my review I was contacted by the restaurant manager. He went above and beyond to make things right. We were very pleased. Thank you for your follow up.","date":"2018-02-11 17:12:59"}

I ordered the lobster risotto. It came out at the same time someone at my table received their scallops. The scallops came on a hot plate and served excellent. My risotto was cold, the plate was cold, and the texture was off. I sent it back and the one that came out was much better tempt wise but was still off in texture for a true risotto. I then ordered a fillet rare. It came out medium leaning more towards medium well. I sent back a second dish. Second one came out perfect. For a restaurant of this stature I should not have had to send back every item I ordered in order for it to be served correctly. On top of this a manager NEVER came over to even address the fact the table had two items refired, let alone a simple table touch. Completely unimpressed. I am a local in the industry, I have opened new restaurants and understand this has only been open very briefly. However, I watched multiple people (who I would assume were managers) walk around the restaurant, and the fact not one of them table touched especially since two items were sent back at my table rubbed me the wrong. Was very bad customer service from a management perspective. An apology from the server is not enough when essentially if he put in the order correctly the outcome of food is not his fault. Inexcusable experience on behalf of management in the crucial early stages of a restaurant to get feedback from guests. Will give a second chance as i believe you can't truly judge a restaurant on one experience, but my expectations will be much higher\n\n\n\n*****edited review\nManager came over as we were receiving our bill and listened to our feedback.

Here is what I believe he would say about our experience.\n\nI made reservations for dinner far in advance for 3 of us and we were celebrating a birthday. On the day of the reservation we had 2 more friends surprise us with their presence, so I needed to expand our seating to 5. I walked in earlier in the day, of our reservation, and asked to change seating to 5. The hostess was so pleasant and made sure we could have 5 for dinner-I'm sure my awesome negotiating skills helped ;)\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"GOOD JOB\" for the Hostess effort.\n\nOnce we were seated if took a long time for the server, Megan, to get to our table. Overall, Megan was awesome and worked very hard. I know it was a very busy evening and many things were out of her control (as you will see later). Waiting 10-12 minutes or more was just too long as she should have been over to our table to introduce herself within 2-3 minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine to start the evening off. Their wine list has some good choices and the wine connoisseur at our table ordered their Faust Napa Cab. 2014. What was then served to us was Faust Napa Cab. 2015. This is a huge pet peeve of mine and happens often (see many of my reviews). Often the excuse is that it's an \"old wine listing.\" I knew this couldn't be the case here as Hell's Kitchen just opened! The 2015 is a bit cheaper than the 2014 although rated high as well. We, in fact, ordered 2 and enjoyed it. The point is to get the wine list 100% correct or your customers will think you are putting one over on them. They lose a full star on the wine vintage problem.\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"YOU DONKEY\" Regarding the vintage.\n\nHere is what we enjoyed and all shared on the dinning side. Wagyu Meatballs (ordinary), lobster risotto (great flavor but served lukewarm), smoked Gouda mac & cheese (awesome), beef wellington (outstanding as promised), short ribs (maybe the best dish), NY strip steak (good) and the brick pressed chicken (too dry). \n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"PISS OFF\" on the chicken. risotto and the meatballs. But....\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"GOOD JOB\" On the beef wellington, mac & cheese, NY strip and short rib.\n\nFor dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding (outstanding) and the pineapple carpaccio (served with dry ice for a wonderful smoke\/fog effect). I ordered black coffee to have with my dessert. The coffee arrived cold! Megan apologized and said they would brew me a new pot. Problem is it took 10 minutes to brew and I had finished my wonderful sticky pudding (I would have loved to have them together). When she finally brought me the fresh brewed coffee it was VERY weak with no flavor  and I couldn't drink it. Megan did take the coffee off the bill, but lack of good coffee can ruin a meal for people like me ;)\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY 'HOW PATHETIC\" Regarding the coffee situation But....\n\nGORDON WOULD SAY \"GOOD JOB\" on the sticky pudding and pineapple carpaccio.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun and energetic and overall I would recommend dinning at Hell's Kitchen. I went in thinking this could be a 5 star for me, but the problems with the long wait, wine vintage, a few of the dishes and the coffee had me take 2 stars off. \n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I may try it again. The negative situations I encountered are so easily corrected. I hope I can come back and give them a full 5 stars. \n\nHEY GORDON \"OVERALL - GOOD JOB!\"","date":"2018-04-04 15:13:44"}

Very knowledgeable of the menu and guided us in choosing the menu classics and secrets here at HK; quick to respond to our requests. Overall, a kind, funny, and very approachable person. If you ever get the chance to come here, ask for David as your server!\n\nFOOD: 97.5 \/ 100\nPan-seared Scallops: Lovely sear on the outside, yet tender and al dente on the inside. The bacon garnish in the center of the plate complemented the scallops's lightly sweet flavor, which were further accented by the sauces. A classic Ramsay dish that I would love to experience again!\n\nWild Mushrooms: A perfect compliment to any beef dish, simple as that! It has an earthiness to it that runs well with the smoothness of the Beef Wellington.\n\nBeef Wellington: Another Gordon Ramsay classic, one that is the hallmark of a Ramsay dining experience! The puff pastry is a shiny golden brown which has an amazing flakiness to it. The beef was a tender medium-rare, which, with the potato puree and demi-glacé, provided a party of flavors in my mouth! Trust me, you don't want to miss out on this!\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding: Wow. The portion size is quite large, so be prepared to share it with others at your table! The toffee pudding was very sweet, so I'd recommend enjoying this slowly, so as not to be overwhelmed by that flavor. The ice cream is a reasonable scoop, and the creaminess of that works well with the light pudding. Trust me, this is a dessert that you won't forget!\n\nWagyu Meatballs: Before talking about the meatballs, let's talk about the polenta croutons! I'd never had polenta before, and after trying it, I have to say that I'm a massive fan! It has a light crunch to it that reminds me of a potato tot -- a tater tot, as it's more commonly known -- which is complemented by the smoothness of the inside of the polenta croutons. As for the meatballs themselves...truly splendid! A firm meatball, as it didn't disintegrate in the lovely marinara sauce, with a punch of flavor that one should come to expect from a meatball! The cheese was an added touch, but felt unnecessary. I'd recommend this appetizer to anyone, second to the pan-seared scallop!\n\nVirgin Manche Whisperer: Whatever the name of this non-alcoholic cocktail is, David sure knows that this is a well-kept secret here. Naturally sweet, nothing that overpowers the other in this fruity concoction! Rolls right off the taste buds and pairs well with any of the dishes on the menu!\n\nVALUE: 90 \/ 100\nFor a party of four, $305 seems overpriced and doesn't provide the best \"bang-for-your-buck\" compared to other dining options on the Strip. However, given the attached baggage that are Gordon Ramsay and the Hell's Kitchen brands, the asking price is justifiable.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 94.2 \/ 100\n\n----------\n\nTL;DR: If you're looking for a dining experience on the Strip that is unforgettable, you can't go wrong with HK! From the pan-seared scallops to the beef wellington, the lobster risotto to the various selection of desserts and drinks, Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen is an unforgettable dining experience that one has to experience if they are unable to head out to Ramsay's three-Michelin-star restaurant in London!","date":"2018-04-04 08:01:32"}

Went here last night to see what the fuss is all about and why it's fully booked for dinner for months. We sat at the bar as it's open seating there. Got there around 7.30 and had to wait close to half an hour before a couple seats became available.\n\nWe started with some cocktails. I tried the Scottish kiss and my friend tried notes from gordon. Both drinks were done well and the notes from Gordon came with a little message in a rolled union jack paper. Kind of like a fortune cookie, except the message contained some joke lol.\n\nWe didn't order any entree as the selections offered were not that interesting. I've had Ramsay's beef wellington before at his steakhouse inside Paris hotel & casino. The only other entree on the menu I would consider trying was the rack of lamb, but I was more interested in trying out the different appetizers, so we ended up sharing lobster risotto, scampi prawn flambe, tuna tartare, and a dozen of oysters. All of them tasted good, but not wow good if you know what I mean. I liked the tuna tartare the best out of all the dishes we tried, but you can get tasty tuna tartare at other places. Nothing really stood out here. I do have to say that the prawns were impressively presented with flaming fire and all, so that was pretty entertaining to watch.\n\nWe closed our dinners with the sticky toffee pudding, which I've also had at Ramsay's pub and it's still one darn good dessert.\n\nMy overall impression is that this restaurant does great presentation with its food (maybe put too much importance on it, instead of focusing on more important thing when it comes to food, namely flavor), but it comes across as quite showy and gimmicky with no great taste and flavor backing the food. Out of his 3 restaurants I've tried here in Vegas, I think the pub is the best one.\n\nWe had great service at the bar and they offer full menu there, so might as well sit there if you don't want to wait for months to get in for dinner. Our bartender, Tim was awesome, so props to him!","date":"2018-06-09 16:55:54"}

We had a reservation and were immediately sat upon arrival. The hostess wished us a happy anniversary as did the server. The restaurant has one of the best atmospheres I've seen. It's large and open which was great. My wife and I each had the filet mignon which was exceptional. However, I had the potatoes au gratin which lacked in seasoning.

The lobster risotto is a must. The short rib grilled cheese had good flavor but make sure you enjoy super crunchy bread.

The pineapple carpaccio was incredible! Not only for the cool presentation with liquid nitrogen, but the citrus foam and coconut sorbet with the sweet pineapple was so tasty and refreshing. \n\nDocked one star because we waited 40 minutes from when we had our appetizer until our entrees. Apparently they burned the pizza and had to remake, but it would've been nice to let us know before we mentioned we were waiting a bit long. Otherwise the rest of service was attentive. Decor was nice as well with pitchforks incorporated all over. \n\nI am glad I went for lunch which felt upscale casual, but reasonable.","date":"2018-02-11 17:07:51"}

We were seated in the area far back from the actual kitchen pass line so it had a hint of privacy. \n\nFor dinner we opted to order the Prix Fixe menu with wine pairings then ordered separate items just to try them out then shared it all.  \n\nPrix Fixe:  Pan seared scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding. \nOther items:  Foie gras, crispy skin salmon, side of wild mushrooms\n\nDrink: started with \"Notes from Gordon\"- Gin, green tea, lemongrass, peach, lemon and a printed quirky quote from Gordon - super yummy, poured at the right strength.  It took awhile for this drink to come out from the bar but our waiter did come by to inform us about its status and apologized for the wait. \n\nPrix Fixe is a must get for all the Gordon Ramsay faves.  The scallops were done really well, the beef Wellington was deceptively filling and the dessert was on point.  The foie gras was interesting cause it came paired with a carrot cake but the way that the salmon was done was perfect for me sitting in between a piece of sashimi and cooked.  However that may put off tastebuds used to \"well done\" fish.    The wild mushroom side that our waiter raved about was a fantastic recommendation.  \n\nService was quite impressive the wait staff were well coordinated providing plenty of top ups of water, coming around sparingly to check on us during our date and super nice right till the end.  \n\nI'd splurge here again!","date":"2018-02-11 16:21:16"}

I am a real fan of Gordon Ramsey and was thrilled to have the opportunity to eat at one of his restaurants.  The service our party of 6 received was truly 5 stars.  I would rate the food 4 stars.  The lobster in the lobster risotto was perfectly cooked but my first bite of the risotto had a few crunchy grains.  I thought about sending it back but there were no more crunchy grains until the last bite which had a few more.  The risotto was a little bland and under seasoned.  My homemade risotto is more flavorful but doesn't include the lobster . . . Sorry Gordon.  For my entree I had the crispy skin salmon.  The salmon could not have been prepared any better!  However, the accompaniments, although good, were not mind blowing.  Why did I rate my experience a 3?  Because of the sheer noise level in the restaurant!  I am an audio\/acoustic engineer.  According to the Sound Pressure Level meter on my phone, the volume in the room averaged 95+dBA!!!  I found I could not hear the waiter's descriptions well and we were screaming at each other across the table.  I understand the desire to have a \"high energy\" atmosphere to make the restaurant exciting, but this is extreme.  Let me know if you want to fix this Gordon.  In summation, not a place for a romantic dinner.  Glad I had the opportunity.  Wouldn't go back based solely on the noise level.","date":"2018-06-09 20:47:48"}

Hands down the best server I've had anywhere. \n\nFood: \nAppetizers - we had scallops and lobster risotto. Taste and cook was great, though as others have said, the scallops are rather thin, and seems like they were cut in half or something. Wasn't a huge deal.\n\nEntree - we had the beef Wellington and crispy skin salmon. Wellington was great as ever (we've eaten at GR steak in Paris a number of times, and it's definitely comparable to the ones there). However, the crispy salmon was a disappointment on two levels: 1) the first time it was overcooked, like pretty noticeably overcooked, so I sent it back. 2) the second plate they brought me was cooked fine, but the fish itself had no seasoning. No salt, no pepper, so the fattiness of the fish got to me really quickly. I didn't send the second plate back because the sauce (which was a bit acidic) helped cut through the fattiness of the salmon and gave it flavor, but it still made for a disappointing salmon experience.\n\nDessert - Ott was super thoughtful and gave us a sticky toffee pudding on the house for my husband's birthday! We weren't expecting it and we're quite delighted, both by the gesture and by the pudding itself. I'm not a fan of toffee, but the toffee pudding was incredible. It's a sweet dessert, but you don't really feel it bc everything just goes so well together.\n\nWine - both our wines (roscato and Jordan Cab Sauv) were quite good.\n\nIf I could give half stars, I would, but since I can't I'm rounding down for the salmon situation. \n\nWould still come back, and maybe the chefs will be able to catch and fix that issue for the future :]","date":"2018-02-24 05:46:08"}

First course, Pan Seared Scallops were the most disappointing. The scallops were only about the size of a quarter. I'm was not expecting jumbo scallops but my friends were much bigger than mine. The taste was just kinda plain, not much flavor. Main Course, Beef Wellington was very good, cooked perfectly. The beef was a little tough but still good. Dessert, Sticky Toffee Pudding was the best part of the meal. Outstanding, \n\nMy only real criticism is the service. Everyone was very professional and polite. Myself and my friend felt as though we were being kinda rushed. The main waitperson was very efficient, we just felt that every time we turned around they were cleaning the plates and moving onto the next course. Move them in and move them out. Obviously this restaurant being what it is, and doing a high volume they turn over a high number of plates per day. We just felt as though we were taking up a table that they needed for the next patron. \n\nOverall, I thought everything was very good but just not great. The service is top notch, the food is about average, it just didn't overwhelm me. I've eaten at many Gordon Ramsey resturants so this was not my first experience. Honestly, this restaurant is just a tourist attraction. From a LV local, I would only return when you have friends in town. Hell's Kitchen is for the people who have never eaten at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and followed his shows not for locals.","date":"2018-07-17 17:01:21"}

She was speedy, exceptionally professional, friendly, and her smile made us feel welcomed. In fact, i very rarely write yelp reviews, but Britney's overzealous approach towards serving us left me feeling compelled to write this review.

Mac and cheese and potatoes au gratin were average to what you would expect.  Food alone I would give it a 3 at least as the Wellington and desert were tasty but the service and timing flaws deserve recognition when you can't even get water or find out when 1\/2 your food is coming.

Appreciate the follow up and shows the focus on making sure the guest experience is corrected where not right.","date":"2018-03-04 13:52:38"}

It's spacious, new and modern. Best to make a reservation otherwise you'll be turned away. I was alone and got seated at the bar within a few minutes. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and restaurant. \n\nThe scallops were tender and cooked to perfection. They are one of my favorites and seeing them cooked on Hells Kitchen compelled me to order them. I was not disappointed. I also ordered pumpkin bisque and that was velvety smooth and tasty.

To be clear, Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas surpassed all my expectations. I've been to several other Gordon Ramsey restaurants around the world (however none of his locations in England where I'm sure his Michelin stars are especially well-deserved) and none of them particularly impressed me. There were always issues with the service, the value, or the execution. \nTonight, I could really appreciate Chef Ramsey's skill, not just as a chef, but as an operator. Most chefs focus so much on the food they forget about the front of the house experience. Hell's Kitchen got so many things right, despite being a \"theme\", kitschy restaurant:\n\n- Our reservation was sat almost to the minute. There's a reason why there are empty tables throughout the restaurant. It's because this isn't a churn and burn ripoff joint; they are timing their reservations properly so that slow table turns do not cause reservations to be delayed. \n- Thought went into the cocktail list, with most drinks requiring actual mixology skills to justify the $14-$16 price point. Presentation of some of the drinks actually resulted in \"dinner and a show\". \n- On a related note, the prices were reasonable, especially by Las Vegas standards. While possibly a more expensive a meal than most of the viewers of the Hell's Kitchen TV show would typically pay, for the quality of cooking, portion sizes, and ingredients, it was on par with most major US metropolitan cities - so relatively cheap by Las Vegas Strip standards. Our dinner the night before was twice the price, definitely had some misses in execution, still left us a little hungry, and was not as comfortable an experience. \n- There was adequate space between the tables. The restaurant is selling out every day and there is room to accommodate at least 15% more seats, if they wanted to emulate a lot of other popular Las Vegas restaurants. Chef Ramsey has instead opted to ensure the dining experience doesn't include your eavesdropping on the neighboring table's conversations. They are foregoing short term profits to provide guests with a positive experience and encourage repeat visitors. \n- The food we ate tonight was excellent. The foie gras was creative and one of the best tasting dishes I've ever had. Chef Ramsey's classic French training shows in the accompanying sauces, with the cauliflower and the salmon of particular note. Seafood is cooked perfectly, as evidenced by the scallops and the salmon. \n- Service is striving for fine-dining level, despite a lower price point and more casual environment. All of the staff were friendly, our server was excellent and comped a beer because the original order was not available. He was also attentive, but not obtrusive. The bussers were timely and cleared all dish and flatware after each course and kept water glasses filled. \n- Every thing was clean. The staff has been well trained to keep everything clean and to pay attention to the details. \n\nWith so many good restaurants in Las Vegas, there are only a few I would plan to visit for a second time, and this is one of them.","date":"2018-03-24 10:17:49"}

My wife had the burger and it was whatever in her opinion. For an appetizer she had the scallops, which the flavor was amazing but portion size left something to be desired.  The lobster risotto was pretty damn good as well. Main entrees left a lot to be desired.

My crispy skin salmon was great and tasty (especially the sauce) & I got a side of mushroom that came recommended by the server. On the other hand, my boyfriend (the birthday boy) got the preset menu that consisted of scallops, beef Wellington and the famous and delicious dessert pudding. I would recommend the preset menu but I'm not a big fan of the Wellington lol \nThe ahi appetizer was tasty as well and at the beginning of the meal, they give a little \"palate cleanser\" \n\nService: 1\/5 \nhere is where it goes downhill! I reserved a table for a party of 9 for my boyfriend's 28th birhday a couple months in advance. He's a big fan of the show so naturally he's excited to come here. We were greeted by the server right away and explained the menu to us. A couple people in our group had an obligation prior so they ate with a couple of friends but still wanted to celebrate with us. Came and sat down and just wanted to order appetizers. When we all ordered and it was their turn, the sever, Michael (with an accent), rudely told them that if they were only gonna order appetizers, they can go ahead and go to the bar instead! I feel that that information could have been communicated differently and not in a rude manner. ESPECIALLY to a group of people who work in the industry. We very well know how we should have been treated. On top of that, two of the people in our group had to catch a show so they left us with cash to pay for their bill. When it was time to ask for their bills,and we wanted to split it, the server was so rude and said \"WHERE ARE THE TWO?!\" In a tone where he's suspecting them to have left without paying. \nWe don't come to fine dining or high class known restaurants just for the good food, we expect to also be treated AT LEAST decently. \nI WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE NOR WILL I BE GOING BACK TO THEM. Everyone saw the picture and asked us how the restaurant was and I couldn't help but to warn others about this experience. \nToday, I  wanted to talk to the manager to relay the experience to prevent it from happening to others. When the hostess, Habica, answered and asked what it was for... I told her it was about a past experience. She told me to hold on but hung up the line. When I called back, she put me on a really long hold. I begun to get the feeling that they don't wanna let me reach any manager.\nFor a new restaurant & especially a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I expected more respect. We often go to the Burger one in planet Hollywood. But obviously, this place needs more training with customer service or just talking to people in a respectful manner. When I called back after getting hung up, the hostess Habica didn't even apologize and said \"it was probably an accident\" \nALSO, the server was so persistent with EVERYONE wanting to order entree that he doubled my friends' appetizers. We even called and asked if it was okay that a couple of people just ordered appetizers and the hostess clearly informed us that it shouldn't be a problem","date":"2018-04-28 18:42:31"}

Plus, the menu was pretty bleak; lamb, chicken and various steaks.\n\nThe issue came because of the brilliance of offering seafood within the appetizers, and I'm allergic to seafood. My friend had no problem with the scallops, as only a moron would choose a Caesar salad instead. That would be me. However, I couldn't have either, as there's anchovy in the dressing. Considering the seared foie gras dish was comparable, other than $3 more, I asked if she could see if they could substitute instead. She returns and says the manager refuses to allow that and she sincerely apologized. I gave her my gratitude and told her not to worry about it, as it's not her call. We ask for the check and leave.\n\nNow, it's not my place to tell anyone operator how to run his business. I mean, taking a $3 hit so I could make over $300 in sales seems like a no brainer to me. However, I am a patron that was discriminated upon because I had an allergy. I know the manager wasn't concerned about earning my business or creating a memorable experience. Having met Chef Ramsay, I know he'd feel guilty about that oversight, take care of his guests and correct the issue moving forward.

Both the wife and I are avid watchers of his namesake Hell's Kitchen show and we both love his Gordon Ramsay Steak, so it was a no-brainer to check out the place for dinner during its soft opening.  The restaurant was, for the most part, aesthetically appealing both inside and out.  However, for obvious reasons, it didn't look like what you see on the TV show.  If there was one thing that detracted for me from the restaurant's aesthetic appeal, it was the waiting area that also served as a gift shop hawking Gordon Ramsay and Hell's Kitchen merchandise.  I understand the reason why it was there, but I thought it was tacky considering none of his other restaurants in town have a similar retail setup, which seemed more akin to something you'd find at Hooters than an upscale restaurant from a Michelin-starred chef.\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:45 reservation and were seated promptly at our appointed time.  We were seated by the windows overlooking the Strip.  It was easily one of the best people-watching spots to be found on the Strip.  I started off with a cocktail while we looked over the menu.  I had the Smoke on the Blvd ($14), a cocktail made with Woodford Rye, Aperol, Averna Amaro, and sweet vermouth and delivered to the table in a stylish cherry wood, smoke-filled glass box.  Given its beautiful presentation and use of premium ingredients, I felt I received tremendous value for my quite delicious cocktail.  As for our food, Hell's Kitchen offers a 3-course tasting menu featuring signature dishes from the show.  It was tempting, however, we opted to create our own multi-course meal.  Several, if not most, of the menu items may be found on the menus of his other restaurants.  That said, it was explained to us that there were subtle differences between similar offerings from his various restaurants.  We shared an order of Lobster Risotto ($24).  I had the Beef Wellington ($49).  The wife had the Herb-crusted Rack of Lamb ($39).  We shared sides of Wild Mushrooms ($9) and Roasted Cauliflower ($9).  We finished off our meal by splitting an order of Sticky Toffee Pudding with Speculoos Ice Cream.  My Beef Wellington was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was oh so tender.  Chef Ramsay wasn't in the house when we were there, but he likely wouldn't have been shouting at anyone for how our food turned out.  Everything looked and tasted great.  Our server David was knowledgeable and attentive and the entire team seemed perfectly choreographed ensuring we had a great experience.\n\nFor sentimental reasons and the almost over-the-top experiences I've had there, Gordon Ramsay Steak remains my favorite Gordon Ramsay restaurant in town.  In the end, Hell's Kitchen was as good as we'd hope it would be.  Even though Hell's Kitchen was only in its soft opening, it seemed like the place was running like a seasoned veteran on the Strip.  It certainly wasn't like the TV show where chefs are frequently getting kicked out of the kitchen for mistakes.  It's a safe bet that this place will be very popular for the foreseeable future.  I recommend planning and making reservations well in advance if you want to secure a table for dinner.","date":"2018-02-12 01:31:29"}

We had the fortunate experience of meeting master mixologist Brian and enjoying his vast knowledge of spirits and food, besides having a refreshing and charming personality. When you visit, try to sit at the bar, find Brian and ask him to make you his fabulous specialty drink: Caribbean Cha Cha, trust me, you will not regret it. Not into that, Brian can make you anything your little heart desires. Oh, the food...let's just say this is where food dreams come to life.","date":"2018-02-12 01:32:28"}

I reserved before I left home almost 2 weeks ago with my opentable app. \n\nIt was very busy at 12:15pm but the staff was welcoming and professional. All smiles and how are you. We had a great window seat watching the stripe. The water was refilled often, dishes were moved in a timely manner and concern from our waiter about our meals was welcomed. \n\nMy husband had the crispy skin salmon dish with the pineapple carpaccio dessert. He loved both and the fan-fair when receiving the dessert, he was ecstatic. I had the tuna tartar, red quinoa salad and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The tuna tartare comes with these chips (not needed) because the appetizer is so freaking delicious itself. Even my picky husband enjoyed some. The red quinoa salad was amazing. It doesn't look like much when you get it but the flavors all blended very well. The sticky toffee pudding for me was too big and I believe needs a little more alcohol (if any was added) it was just warm and sweet. (I've had delicious sticky toffee pudding in NYC at Blue Smoke.)\nOverall spending about $114.00, it was a great experience and the food, service and ambiance were on point. I will go again. \n\nThank you for the anniversary lunch.","date":"2018-08-15 02:05:34"}

Almost everything was absolute perfection. My party of 3 arrived at 6:43 for a 6:45 reservation and were immediately taken to our table, which was in the middle of the main dining area and had full view of the open kitchen. Our waiter, Ott, was charming and engaging, giving a great preview of the experience. \n  Our drink orders were taken promptly and brought out quickly. Once our drinks arrived we placed out orders my friend and I each ordered a Dry Aged New York Strip and my girlfriend ordered the Short Rib we also got an order of potato gratin for the table. When our food arrived my strip was seasoned well and cooked to a perfect medium rare as I had ordered. My girlfriends short rib was also delicious and didn't need a knife to cut. For dessert I had the pineapple ganache and my table mates had the chocolate mousse cake. My dessert was sweet and light and the perfect finish to a great meal.\n I noticed during our experience there was a severely inebriated gentleman who was being asked to leave. The management handled this quickly and with discretion.\n The only slight criticism I have is that it is slightly louder than I prefer, but I think that it is designed that way for ambiance.","date":"2018-03-16 16:56:54"}

I made reservations for my friend and I for lunch about 2 months in advance (highly recommend doing this for either lunch or dinner).  We were seated at a table with a wonderful view of Caesar's Palace and the strip.  Our server was fantastic-Since it was our first time there, we asked for recommendations. My friend was going to initially order a pancake dish and the server told her it was more of a kid's dish.  She suggested either the beef Wellington or the short ribs. We both ended up ordering the braised short ribs-The best decision ever!!  Both dishes came out piping hot and stayed that way until the very last bite.  The short rib was so incredibly tender and the polenta was so flavorful.  For dessert my friend and I shared the pineapple carpaccio-thinly sliced pineapple with 5 small scoops of coconut sorbet. It was the perfect way to cleanse the palette and end the meal with a dessert that wasn't heavy.  Our server was fantastic-she checked in on us to make sure we were doing ok and to make sure that our water glasses were always full.  \n\nI plan to return Hell's Kitchen on my next trip back to Vegas!","date":"2018-06-27 01:28:56"}

We then moved onto a Caesar Salad, unlike any Caesar I had had before, with a hint of lemon zest giving it a wonderful citrus zing and perfectly toasted croutons.  From there, guests were offered a choice of Crispy Skin Salmon, Filet Mignon or Vegetable Risotto.  I had the Filet and it was perfectly Medium Rare and excellently seasoned with no need whatsoever for salt and pepper (in fact they were not even on the table).

I wanted to make it something special. This is one of my most memorable and loved dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas. We went her to celebrate my B-day. My wife and I have been fans of Gordon Ramsay and Hell's Kitchen for years, so when they finally opened a restaurant combining both of those elements, we had to check it out. \n\nFirstly, the environment, decor, ambiance whatever you want to call it, is a lot of fun and also very swanky and Vegasy at the same time. When you walk up to the restaurant you see the HK trident with flames cascading around the sign. When you walk in the front door you are greeted by a digital version of Gordon Ramsay on a screen, welcoming you to Hell's Kitchen. I recommend you spend some time just hanging around and watching this, because it's both entertaining and hilarious. Eventually he starts flinging obscenities and snide remarks in a way that only Ramsay can do.\n\nWe had made reservations ahead of time (DO THIS OR YOU WON'T GET IN!) We were promptly seated by a polite wait staff. I gawked at the kitchen the whole way to our table, because it is an open\/split kitchen very similar to the Hell's Kitchen show. You have a red and blue side with people working at the pass. It's really a sight to behold, and it's fun to see in person.\n\nWe had a great seat near the strip, so we could watch the entertainment in the restaurant or out on the strip. Both were fun to see while we dined. Speaking of, we split the beef wellington. It's very famous for being ordered on the show, and they always screw it up ON THE SHOW...but they absolutely nailed it at the restaurant. The filet portion was soft and succulent with a crispy puff pastry. The balsamic reduction served alongside the meat is perfect to pair with the wellington. The root vegetables were insanely delicious that came with the meal. I just wish there were more of them. I would have eaten a whole plate of those, they were cooked perfectly and well flavored.\n\nOkay, so we have to talk about the sticky toffee bread pudding. Why? Well, I'm not a huge sweets person. I guess I'm getting old and crotchidy, but my wife insisted we order it, so we did, and I had a bite...then another bite, and another and another and so on. I think I ate more of it than my wife did, and I didn't want to really eat dessert at first. It was just incredible, and it is easily one of the top 3 desserts I've ever eaten. So get that and the Welly, and you're going to be a happy camper. Great to see Vegas opening some new fine dining restaurants like this. I can't wait to go back ASAP!","date":"2018-07-26 20:37:30"}

Looked pretty full at noon on a weekday though so keep that in mind.  The waiter seemed very pushy and needy almost to an annoyance, pushing \"Hell's Kitchen\" TV show items, but in all the wait staff kept our waters full and the meal and dessert came out incredibly fast.  \n\nWe each had a burger and fires off the lunch menu.  Pricey at $20+ but a very good burger nonetheless.  It came with a cup of fries that were pretty average.  Similar thickness to a fish and chip-type of fry, but could have used more seasoning or a spicier dipping sauce.  The Hell's Kitchen burger was very interesting, being that it had avocado on the bottom and bacon top, leading to a very soft bite each time.  Taste was excellent, as was the extra kick of the ghost pepper cheese (very mild \"ghost pepper\" if any).  Had a soft kick but nothing more than a typical jalapeno cheese.  The burger was very good though and worth an order.  Large portions as well.  We had to try the toffee pudding to end, of course.  It came out in less than 5 minutes from placing the order, as if it was waiting for us.  Steam coming off the dessert, and topped with a butterscotch ice cream, this dish was sweet yet didn't overcome your taste buds.  I could have eaten three of these myself.  Honey on the bottom made this a perfect dessert and easily one of the must orders of Vegas.\n\nHell's Kitchen is another quality spot from Gordon Ramsay.  The menu offers enough options that you could either go big or just have a quality, well-cooked meal.  Tough to get here from Caesar's as it involves a long walk from the parking lot, so I recommend coming form outside fi you can.  For $60+ for two after tip, it is certainly a hefty lunch, but I was surely not disappointed in anything I ordered.","date":"2018-08-15 01:17:40"}

The place looks so cool, awesome design etc. We had an 8:30 reservation and it was for my birthday (which we put in the reservation and also I was told happy birthday when I arrived) we sat down, and since I have both a dairy and gluten allergy I started asking obvious questions- the waiter had a list that needed some updating but we figured out that I could eat something other than steak. We both ordered a glass of wine, and the pours were super small, but the wine was good. Moving on, my husband for beef Wellington which he said was delicious. Half way though he realized he would like some extra sauce for his meal.... we also asked for a wine list. The waiter then looked at us and said ok just so your aware the sauce is $5........ \nsoooooo we were a bit shocked bc Jesus Christ, this isn't like a cheap place-- they can't afford a little extra sauce !? But we said ok, since he wasn't going to sacrifice his meal for the lack of sauce. 15 mins later a guy comes over with the sauce and we look at him like UM- take it back we don't need this now, even the worlds slowest eater couldn't have taken That long to eat what was left. Also- the waiter was obsessed with taking my wine glass!!!! Like as if I was going to steal it. It was sooooo weird. The \"assistant\" Dina was awesome, she should have been our waitress bc it would have been a better experience. I think this is a one time experience place, but with better service and more options (and less cheap behaviors) we would maybe return. Also! Not to do anything for my birthday was a bit off as well.

Being huge fans of Gordan Ramsay and even watching the Hell's Kitchen season about this location, we were excited to try this out. The inside is very well decorated and you get to see the red\/blue sides of the kitchen. Little tip, if you want to go for dinner or eat from the dinner menu, but it is booked, make a reservation for lunch around 3 or 3:30 as they switch menus at 3:30. \nJ: I ordered the signature, which means I got the scallops, beef wellington, and the dessert (sticky toffee pudding). The scallops were cooked perfectly, but were barely warm. Did not care that much for the pea puree, but the bacon bits were a good add on. Beef wellington was simply delicious, lived up to all the hype from watching Gordon Ramsay's shows. But surprisingly, the best part was the sticky toffee pudding. It is larger than what you would expect from a high end restaurant, but still did not come with enough. The combination of ice cream and toffee with the soft pudding was to die for.\nN: Being pescatarian, I was actually interested in getting the LOBSTER wellington, since I've seen it so much on the show, sadly to only notice that salmon was the only seafood option under entrees. BUT, I was definitely not disappointed when the citrus flavored salmon arrived and was cooked beautifully. The flavor was not too overpowering - literally perfection! I also ordered Potato Gratin as a side, which was really TASTY, I just wish it was more cheesier. I also definitely can not get over how BOMB the sticky toffee pudding was- WOW, I'm a dessert enthusiast and that was honestly one of my favorites ever!!","date":"2018-05-30 04:40:17"}

From the beautiful decor, to the fun and vibrant staff members, you will defiantly have a great experience here.  I decided to try this place out on a early Saturday afternoon which was a good choice, considering that when I left the line was wrapped out the door.  During my visit I started off with the Lobster risotto.  For my main dishes I ordered the pre fixe hk express three-course menu (Caesar salad, beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding).  First, let me start off by saying that I ordered WAY to much food and was completely stuffed by the end of the meal.  Now, the lobster risotto, was simply amazing!  It arrived at the perfect temperature, the lobster was cooked perfectly.  It was not rubbery as some places serve it.  The lobster also contained a nice vibrant butter taste to it.  The butter was not overwhelming and it hit the palette just at the right moment, that enchanted the flavoring of the dish.\nNow, the Caesar salad was okay, I think it could of had a little less dressing on it.  The beef wellington I was actually scared to try, because I prefer my meat to be cooked medium well, but to my surprise this was amazing.  No blood running from my meat, the meat was tender and warm.  I think what also helped the dish was the pastry outer crust that was flaky and a little buttery. Lastly, I wasn't sure what Sticky Toffee pudding was, but when I tried it for the first time, I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  The warm cake like substance, that folded into a soft pudding texture topped with a rich cookie butter ice cream was everything.  Definitely, a crown winner.","date":"2018-08-24 16:35:00"}

I was super excited to dine at this location and meet the new Hells kitchen winner chef Michelle. We made reservations and they are booked up for months ---literally months. But luckily we were able to snag a table while we're in Vegas. The location is right by Caesar's Palace and it is as grand as everything is in Vegas. Although I know Gordon Ramsey has very high expectations for every aspect of his restaurant, there is room for improvement that needs to be taken place. To start the service could be better I wasn't blown away especially in a competitive city like Vegas where there's a restaurant on every corner every street. Although the restaurant is beautiful there's no details \nSpared. I love how everything comes together for the theme for Hells kitchen. You will notice pitchforks just like the way you would see on the show. We both ordered plenty of food they have some amazing cocktails but I opted for the nonalcoholic drinks which was equally delicious. If you are looking for nonalcoholic options try the aqua fresca watermelon, it is quite delicious the next thing I remember is the beef Wellington and also the scallop appetizers. They melted right in our mouths. The lobster risotto was amazing too. Pretty much all of the iconic dishes that you see on Hells kitchen. The beef Wellington for both of us came out over cooked and we were forced to wait for them to re-cook another one so that it could be done correctly that was a little disappointing but they were eager to fix it. The other  highlight of the meal is the sticky taffy pudding cake. The serving size is big. I couldn't see myself finishing that. Great size for sharing. Overall, the beef Wellington and the taffy pudding for the win!!! I am glad I came to dine in but probably wouldn't come back unless it was better execution for dishes.","date":"2018-04-16 15:14:12"}

When our apps arrived we hadn't ordered our dinner yet. The server asked to take the menus away so they were not in our way. Then brought them back afterwards! This was shocking to me because usually they rush you to order dinner. We ordered the seared scallops for an app, they were the best I've ever had. I then got the braised short rib for dinner and it was so yummy. We ended up ordering the mushrooms, potatoes and mac & cheese as sides. It was way too much! Mac & cheese was great but we didn't need it. Mushrooms were a great add too a steak dinner like the Wellington. My husband had that and it didn't disappoint. Overall, I highly recommend.

He wanted our experience to be perfect and he did everything in his power to exceed our expectations and make fantastic recommendations. He went above and beyond to make our lunch an unforgettable experience.\n\nFood was fantastic. We got the seafood tower for one, which was a very generous serving and presented beautifully. Of course, we needed to get the scallops, which were just as perfect as we expected in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The potato puree underneath the scallop was delicate, buttery and delicious. We definitely could have had many more orders of that.\n\nMy husband got the burger as an entree, which he was disappointed. He felt that the meat was under-seasoned and lacking in flavor. He did enjoy the toppings on the burger though. Definitely lacking a little salt and pepper.\n\nI got the truffle gouda pizza, which was delicious. Very rich and satisfying. \n\nLet's not forget about the cocktails as that was our favorite part. Our waiter recommended a smoked bourbon that came presented in a smoky chamber that you opened to be presented with a smoky, delicious drink. Might have gone down a little too smooth. Our waiter was just as excited to present the cocktail to us as we  were to receive the drink.\n\nLastly, we ended with a delicious pineapple dessert that also came presented with a cold smoke and foam with this delicious coconut cream. \n\nThis was much more than a late lunch. We really just had a blast with the staff and other nearby tables with the fun, interactive experience this restaurant has.","date":"2018-04-16 19:18:33"}

Crispy salmon - the flavours were nice, but I found the fish slightly overdone. Beef Wellington - I'm not a big meat-eater, but it was perfectly cooked, tender, and delicious. I wouldn't say that either meal was \"extraordinary\" though. The sticky toffee pudding is a must-try - fantastic - very heavy, so save room. The pineapple carpaccio was also another popular dessert amongst other reviews - the dry ice was cool, but not enough to mask the sour pineapple. Citrus foam made it more sour - almost an assault to the taste buds. The coconut sorbet offset the tartness of the pineapple, but there wasn't enough on the plate. \n\nService was great. Very attentive staff. \n\nWonderful dining experience overall.","date":"2018-04-29 15:32:03"}

When it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant I always expect awesome but with this experience I got a stellar experience .\n\nThis place really is best for someone who knows the show to fully understand the experience but as far as the food goes it's Amazing but the awesome effects and setting is what made this awesome . As you walk in they have the entrance decked with merch and a cool thing with Gordon doing various stuff on a screen which for me is awesome .. if you are coming to town make a reservation and don't give up hope as it does open up when folks cancel .. \n\nI got mine on opentable for my birthday feb 10 ... which was a Saturday . It's at Caesars but in the old serendipity location which means the uber : lyft drop you just go down the walkway and it's there ..\n\nWe arrived about 20 minutes before our 6:15 reservation some of the hostesses were really great at ignoring people so my one take away would be they could be a little more attentive ... however the one who ended up seating us was awesome .. but I'll shout her out later ..\n\nWe made our way to the bar and the bartenders were all pretty busy and it took a bit to get someone to greet us but once Kevin made his way to us he hooked us up with some cool starter drinks .. since I didn't have a seat I opted to try notes from Gordon and it was delicious ... my mom got meet your maker and it was good if you are a whiskey fan .\n\nThing with the drinks is they have awesome flavor but a lot of them have cool effects if you want experience drinks you go with rum donkey that is a tiki and lights on fire or there is one that smokes and I have already forgotten the name but we ended up with that too but my favorite was the Fear and loathing because I love mezcal and it really had the flavor behind it ... with that said if you drink these cocktails are worth it !!\n\nOnce our table was ready  Andrea seated my Mom while I settled the bar tab and even came back to get me so I could find our table . She was awesome and said Happy Birthday as I got to my table which had an epic view of the fountain and the strip . It was exactly what I wanted because even tho I love the show I prefer a pretty view and quieter area .\n\nWe got Blessed with Derek for our server who not only has an epic smile but great energy and is on top of his game making sure we had everything we need while recommending good stuff !! My mom isn't a fan of rare meat so we had to do some menu work arounds but he handled I all awesome sauce style .. \n\nI could go into detail on the food but that usually isn't my style so I won't break all the food down but I'm gonna shout out some of the winners ... \nI feel if you're going with the Wellington you won't be disappointed .. I was a bit worried cause some folks had issues with it not being cooked right but mine came out perfect and my other half that I had left over was still delicious the next day . I got the tasting menu because my Mom wanted sticky toffee pudding ... the scallops were good..\n\nThe pumpkin soup is sooo worth it!!! I imagine if you came for lunch it would pair awesome with some of the sandwiches but we both loved it with our meal .. my mom doesn't even like soup and she licked her bowl clean lol \n\nOur lobster risotto was delicious and remember it's an appetizer so the portions that people complain about need to get a reality check that it isn't an entree but for us it melted in our mouth ...\n\nWe had Mac and cheese & calliflower (spelling) both were really delicious \n\nNow I already shouted out Derek's praises but I really want to make a point to say for a Saturday one that both Gordon and Michelle were here plus chef christina he did so awesome but another superstar was our busser Jason ..\n\nHe made sure we had water , our plates were cleared and that we got our stuff to go he was such a nice guy considering how busy it was and he really helped Derek shine so if the manager is reading this please give them credit where credit is due ..\n\nOver all if you enjoy the show ... get the chance to get a reservation... Come check this place out !!!","date":"2018-02-12 15:56:44"}

As I cook them as well often!\n\nUpon arriving we had reservations with our whole family, everyone was very polite and friendly.\n\nWe got to our table and immediately noticed the porterhouse steak for 2 was nowhere to be found. I was shocked!\n\nOur waiter finally came by and I asked what happened to it, he said it was replaced by the tohamack steak (which is a fancy way of saying a long bone in ribeye).  I asked why and he said it was a hard steak to cook right.  Even more shocked he said that, this coming from a so called prestigious restaurant.  As I mentioned earlier I cook them amazing myself.\n\nSo I settled for the next best thing a so called 30 day dry aged ribeye for 2 to split with my wife. \n\nAs time went on still never got water, eventually came, then they left without asking if we want beer or cocktails. I flagged a bus boy walking by to order us drinks which came late later.  Everyone was very nice though, I believe understaffed and lack of attention to detail.\n\nWe all got lots of appetizers to share was all good but very unflaver full, looked nice but didn't match the looks.\n\nOk no big deal I'm here for the dry aged steak but settled for the other cut (because they can't cook a porterhouse) as the waiter said.\n\nThe steak finally came I ordered it rare as you should with any good steak.  The presentation was great I was excited.  The moment of truth took a bite and was very plane no flaverfull taste or nice marbling as you would get with any 30 day DRY AGED steak.\n\nShocked I asked the waiter are you sure this is dry aged?  He said yes.  I don't know what they consider dry aged, I think it was 30 days WET AGED.  As had no flavor black angus has a better tasting steak being it's not dry aged and a 5th the price.\n\nI asked for him to bring salt and pepper.  He said only they can add pepper for me said fine.  Then he gave me a minute bowl of salt to add.  Was eatable after that.\n\nThen the size was not for 2 people but 1.  The weight of the long bone was most of it.  Even with sides and I am a small person.  \n\nThen he came by and said the salt is strong as to not add much like I never ate a steak in my life he did so politely being French.\n\nWe got the desert and that was the only item that stood out as worth it at a classy restaurant and I hate sweets.\n\nOverall it is a scam just to charge for the name if the food matched it by all means, if I had the capitol I would smoke him at steaks being as they canceled the best steak on earth due to lack of skill.\n\nGo for the photos and desert only. My opinion.","date":"2018-03-05 00:46:31"}

Everyone was definitely excited ! Well, a tragedy is an understatement... On yelp it has four pages of reviews - maybe 2 or 3 comments are good, the rest are terrible - sad but true ! Fried chicken cooked way too long - dark on the outside, dry on the inside.. yikes!  Everything is ala carte and cooked too long or just unpalatable.

It was the bachelorette herself, our other best friend, and myself (in which we've all been best friends for 20 years now)- just the 3 of us before the other girls arrived before the craziness of a bachelorette really starts. We had such an amazing time here. We were seated in the middle area in front of the kitchen staff - red & blue teams! Our server was John Frangakis and if you don't have him as your server, well then I can't promise you'll have the same memorable experience as we did. He helped us decide which dishes to share, which bottle of wine to order, made sure our table, napkins, glasses, etc weren't a mess or dirty in any way, and made sure to offer to take our picture in front of the kitchen before we all got really full off of eating everything we ordered! He's the server you expect at restaurants because he went above and beyond any dinner expectations. My best friend started off her bachelorette just right in the right way. The food was amazing from the beef wellington, salmon, foie gras, scallops, wine, and that TOFFEE PUDDING. Every single dish and e v e r y s i n g l e B I T E was A M A Z I N G, I'm pretty sure everything melted in the way that food should melt on your palette!! The atmosphere didn't feel uptight and maybe it was just my table that was exuding excitement, but just like vegas - you make the experience how you want. Everything and I mean everything went successfully unforgettable at this dinner. Thank you Hell's Kitchen and John for making every moment of this dinner memorable.

You are walked by the dueling red and blue open kitchens on your way to the table. The hostesses have these fire red dresses and the pitchfork motif is noticeable throughout.  \n\nThe food is mostly elevated casual fare from burgers to fuller entrees. Of course I had to try the signature beef Wellington. I opted for the course menu at lunch time. I had the Cesar salad which was typical but good and quite a large portion. The pumpkin soup was very tasty with a bit of unexpected heat. My entree, the Wellington, disappointingly was only a half portion. I suppose all those years of build up in my mind of watching it being made on the show gave me a preconceived notion of how it would taste. The filet was perfectly tender and fork cut-able, nicely medium rare. I think it just didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would and the pastry dough was not as crisp or flaky as I hoped. If more of the sauce\/demi glacé was on the plate the dish might have been more enjoyable for me. Lastly the toffee pudding with a speculos ice cream was moist but too sweet for me. I couldn't eat the whole thing, it was a good portion. I think if it had less drizzled syrup or whatever it was that made the cake very moist, it would have been less sweet and perfect. \n\nOur waiter was very attentive. I thought the overall experience was well timed. Just the food was perhaps overpriced, although with it's location in the Cesar and link to the popular show, perhaps it is justified for many.

Definitely one of the best meals we've ever eaten. We liked it so much we came back for lunch the next day, and our server, James, was fantastic.

We had to wait for at least 10 minutes before we got any service or acknowledgement that we were there. the food was not prepared correctly, I asked from my steak to be medium well and got it very overly well done. He ordered a beef Wellington and only received half of a beef Wellington. The best part of the meal was the risotto (I don't even like rice) and the desert. We could not see the kitchen from where we were sitting due to the big wall and that is part of the reason we went there because we like watching the chefs cook. We spent $180 for crappie service and food. We ended up going to the buffet at our hotel and it was much better and cheaper.

Beef Wellington is by far the best one I have ever eaten, the flavor was all there and it was nice and pink in the middle. The peppers that came with the Ny Strip gave it so much flavor to the dish, that we all had to just have some! Filet Mignon was delicious and came with small tomatoes on the vine, for someone that is not big on tomatoes those were DELICIOUS.

Everything was outstanding from our super knowledgeable waiter (casey) to the last bite of dessert. Casey started out making sure there were no food allergies, which there are. I am allergic to shellfish and just dont eat fish of any kind. All 3-of us decided to order something different and just share. We ordered the short rib grilled cheese, braised short ribs, an jidori chicken scallopini. Holy cow! Amazing amazing amazing!!! Each dish was perfection! I started with the short rib grilled cheese. First bite was amazing, addre the pickled veggies that came on the side, even better! The chips it comes with are pretty good too. Then came the jidori chicken. Holy bleep bleep bleep was it good! The sauce was incredible! Last I tried the braised short ribs. Holy bleeping bleep bleep. So so so good! Everything about it was excellent! Finally it was dessert time!! We ordered the pinapple carpacchio, and the sticky toffee pudding. The pineapple carpacchio was nice and light and refreshing. And came with a really cool presentation. Served with coconut sorbet. I was nervous about the sticky toffee pudding. I know that dessert is made with dates and was affraid it was going to taste like it. Boy was I wrong! It just melts in your mouth and is soooooo good.

Unfortunately, the replacements fared no better and were returned. \nStrike one for the appetizers. \nFor the main course we had two orders of the Beef Wellington and a Steak. \nThe steak was good, however, the vaunted Wellington, one of Ramsey's Signature dishes was pedestrian, dried out with little flavor. \nThe side dish of a mashed potato was the highlight of the event and represented my dinner. \nThe Mac & Cheese was also below par. \nI will however give The \"Devil his due\" as the waitstaff and bartenders were \"spot on\" with their service and breath and scope of the menu. \nIf only we could get those \"Donkeys\" in the Kitchen to pick up their game! \nSorry Gordon, but it wasn't worth the wait or money.

We dined with our 1.5 year old who was making a huge mess throwing his food all over the floor. The staff patiently cleaned up after him constantly to keep the floor clean, they did this with a smile and were so sweet to our little guy. That is above and beyond great service! \n\nThe restaurant is beautiful, high ceilings and huge windows make the space so open and it has modern and lovely decor. Spotlessly clean.\n\nAnd the food. It's famous for a reason. You simply have to experience it. We came for lunch and had the 3 course meal - Caesar salad or soup, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding for dessert. This is a pretty great deal at $60. The beef wellington is served medium rare, this is far more rare than I am usually willing to try but it is phenomenal. For the lunch the portion is a half portion - for me this was more than enough. Everything was perfect and delicious and I cannot recommend this place enough!\n\nJust a tip - we were carded here! I haven't been carded in years and actually hadn't bothered to bring ID with me from the hotel and so wasn't able to have a beer with lunch! Worked out though because I tried one of their mocktails made with ginger beer which was amazing!","date":"2018-09-04 04:37:20"}

There were no reasonable reservations to be had; I called a few times myself, employed American Express platinum concierge for help and asked our hotel for help getting a table for dinner, all unsuccessfully. So my wife and I decided to just head in around dinner time to gauge what the wait time looked like, and I think we were quoted a couple hours. However, the high-tops by the bar, and the bar seating itself, are all first-come-first-served seating and there was a nice table open and available--we literally got right in and seated immediately. The service was good and, as expected, the food was great. We ordered a few beers and the scallops appetizer, a braised short rib and the roasted rack of lamb for mains. For dessert, on the waiter's recommendation, we shared a sticky toffee pudding. I tasted everything we ordered and was honestly surprised to like it all. I think my favorite was actually the short rib, cooked to perfection. But seeing a variety of dishes being carried out of the kitchen area, as well as reading others' reviews of their experiences here, it doesn't seem like there's a bad choice to be had from this menu. The kitchen is visible from every seat in the restaurant, and the service definitely lives up to the expectations you might have from the Hell's Kitchen TV show. Of course, I'd recommend making a reservation, but if there are none to be had, or you're just visiting spontaneously, give the bar seating a shot.","date":"2018-07-09 15:42:07"}

The inside of the restaurant was dazzling, and youre immediately greeted by a huge screen displaying Gordon Ramsay. We had a window seating which viewed the vegas strip and it was quite romantic.\n\nI love that the dish I wanted, came in like this 3 meal combo for $70 which includes the scallops for appetizer, beef wellington for the entree (which was perfect since I wanted this) and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Not bad of a deal for all 3 right?! Scallops were cooked to perfection that like had this green puree underneath. Definitely melts in your mouth! My beef wellington I requested Medium rare, and it came out exactly how I ordered and let me tell you, it lived up to all my expectations. The puff pastry was just perfect along with the potato puree.

A year ago I went to Gordan Ramsay steak and had his infamous beef wellington there for the first time and was so stunned by how great it tasted, so naturally I was extremely excited to check this place out.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant slightly early, but the place was so overbooked that we had to stand in line for 15 minutes in order to be seated.\n\nWe ordered two sets (which comes with seared scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding), short ribs, new york strip, and wagyu meatballs amongst the four of us. \n\nThe appetizers were underwhelming- my scallops looked more like boiled\/poached then seared that we had to send it back into the kitchen. And even the second time, they were inconsistent. Some of the scallops were seared on one side, some were more seared than others, and some were still not seared... (see my pictures)\nSeared (boiled) scallops: 2\/5 stars\n\nThe meatballs were a-ok, we thought it was a little underwhelming, it had a bit of kick, but the flavors weren't up-to-par. \n3\/5 stars\n\nEntrees were great and consistent, we enjoyed them a lot, for some reason the beef wellington did not taste as good as the first time I had it at GRSteak, it was under-seasoned and the meat was more chewy. The short ribs and new york strip, nevertheless had great taste and sear. \noverall: 4\/5 stars\n\nFor dessert, since our scallop dish was so disappointing, chef sent us a pineapple dessert, which was perfectly refreshing. The toffee puddings were good at first, but they were so big and chunky and overly sweet that I had to give up after 2 bites, as I felt the tingle in the back of my throat for having too much sugar at once. \n4\/5 stars\n\nService, nevertheless, was spectacular, our server was attentive, polite, and our water was always filled. She came to check on us for the right amount of times, and even offered to switch out our scallops for the third time, but since we were so hungry we just ate them regardless.\n5\/5 stars\n\nOverall its sadly an OK, a little disappointing as I am a huge fan of hells kitchen and anything Gordan Ramsay related. After all, still glad that I got to try this place, but for the price (~$90 per person) vs quality (eh), I probably will never be back.","date":"2018-05-10 15:58:52"}

I got the pre fix with scallops to start! These were so tasty! Better than the ones at Giada that's for sure. Then the famous beef Wellington ! Soooooo good! I asked for extra wine sauce (sorry) and got it right away. My friend ordered the lamb which he loved and my other friend got the Gouda Mac and asparagus soup! All the food was great no complaints from me! We ended with the famous sticky toffee dessert and almost died and went to Heaven right there.

Being Hell's Kitchen show fanatics, watching all seasons and episodes; our expectations for a fun and experience filled evening awaited us. After being seated we were greeted by our friendly server, who explained the menu in depth and told us about Gordon himself. She asked if anyone had any food allergies, impressive and responsible...thanks for that! I asked if Gordon was in the house, but she sadly informed us that he was not; as he was a busy man tending to his 50 other restaurants and to his wife and kids. I mean really? Who instructs employees to say shit like this! Moving on, we ordered drinks next. The Notes From Gordon was flavorful and refreshing, although the note was not hand-written nor personal; and felt like it had come off of the printing press. The Innis and Gunn beer was delicious as well. We began to place our dinner order, all of us initially decided to get the pre-fixe; that is until the waitress mentioned that the Beef Wellington is served medium-rare. Two of us stated that we preferred medium instead, at which time she stated that it simply was not possible. She indicated that the chef would not even consider such a request. So now we had to stop the ordering process; to re-review what two of us would now be ordering. I decided on the Short Rib, and the my partner switched to a Filet Mignon medium-well. The other party at our table ordered the Wellington, Caesar Salad, Lobster Risotto. We also ordered mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes. Caesar salad and Lobster Risotto came out right away. The Caesar was underwhelming at best; but I did enjoy the touch of vinegar in the dressing. The risotto was a tiny portion (think one small scoop of porridge); Lobster was fresh and delicious, and risotto flavorful but sadly luke-warm. After eating the appetizers, it then took 55 minutes until dinner arrived. By this point we were thinking, how the heck is this place going to survive turning tables after 3 hours from start to finish? Dinner arrives finally at which point my friends Filet Mignon came out medium-rare (what a rude snub); to initially suggest that while the Wellington temperature could not be changed, and to then indicate that steaks could be ordered any way. Also, before anyone even began to eat, we were still waiting on one of our parties entrees; in addition to the Filet having to be sent back. So now two of us began to eat, while Filet Mignon was sent back. My shortrib entree was luke-warm, stringy, overcooked and had absolutely no depth of flavor. In fact, everyone had a bite and said it was really missing flavor at all. It kind of tasted like stringy brisket lol...YUCK! The Wellington was the star of the show, as we all had a bite and found it delicious. About 10 mins later the botched Filet Mignon comes out, now a new thinner cut of meat (1\/2 the size of the original steak); and low and behold it is also medium rare. We were completely over this amateur hour blunder; and the manager that came to our table nor our waitress gave a crap. They both just rushed off after dropping the steak back at the table, what a joke at this point. The Filet they brought back was basically a big F U from the chef; otherwise it would have been corrected to perfection with a sincere apology. Sticky toffee pudding was excellent, Specaloos cookie butter ice cream not a very good flavor match to the amazing pudding. The cookie beneath the ice cream is not in fact a cookie, but a flavorless Bisquick flatbread. The pudding however was stupendous. Overall we all expected so much more from the experience. We thought that there actually would have been a true Hell's Kitchen on stage experience. The music in the restaurant was very loud, and had no reflection of Hell's Kitchen theming. There needs to be yelling and screaming in the kitchen; even if it is totally an act on the part of the chefs. People want to feel as if they are in a true Hell's Kitchen reinactment! Do NOT come here expecting any such experience, as it simply does not exist at this time. Note to Gordon - Please get your bum into this establishment more often than not! You need to put your personal TV touch into the embodiment of your employees and restaurant. You have a lot of future potential customers to woo and to wow. Why not let them leave Hell's Kitchen feeling like they just got off the TV set themselves. After all I assume that you desire a long term success, and future expansion from such. Gordon, please put yourself in your customers shoes, and let their experiences in this establishment; leave their jaws on the floor from the excitement and the flavors of the kitchen.","date":"2018-01-23 04:53:13"}

There were some people asking if they could be seated without reservation and they were told reservation only. The restaurant looks just like the show, the line was dressed half red\/blue with the open kitchen view. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant along the glass with a beautiful view of the strip. There are tv's along the wall, that are playing different seasons of the tv show. Our server Christopher was wonderful, he was so attentive and even asked if we were fans of the show? He let us know that Chef Michelle was working the line and we were more than welcome to ask for a picture with her. He recommended several dishes from appetizers to entrees, to a pre-fixed menu as well. He was the best, he even said happy birthday to me and thanked me for celebrating my birthday at the restaurant. I decided to go with the pre-fix menu which was pan seared scallops and the beef Wellington and a perfect pudding cake desert. My husband ordered the lobster risotto and the rack of lamb that was recommended by our server Christopher. The scallops were perfectly seared with a pea purée under each scallop, which was so delicious. The lobster risotto was cooked to perfection, the lobster was so tender and full of flavor.  The beef Wellington is cooked medium rare and comes with a potato purée and carrots. The meat was so tender, the dough had this crispy\/ flaky layer that just melted in your mouth! The rack of lamb was also cooked medium rare, and you are given 3 chops. It comes with a carrot\/curry purée, it compliments well with the lamb, but not a big fan of the curry. When it came time for dessert, they gave us a complimentary birthday candle on top of the most amazing ice cream I have ever tasted. It was a scoop of ice cream made of gingerbread and caramel on top of a toffee pudding cake that just melts in your mouth after every bite! We were very pleased with this place!

Heartily recommend. My wife and I had the rack of lamb as entrees while my niece had the tuna tartar and mac and cheese. The lamb was excellent and a nice size portion. It was served with a carrot puree I think which complemented well. I didn't try the tuna but she loved it. The Mac was crazy good. Definitely recommend. My mother in law had the short ribs and enjoyed them though very rich. We finished with the sticky pudding. I have a sweet tooth and this was awesome. \nOverall very impressed and definitely recommend while in Vegas.  Make reservations early. They are very booked ahead.","date":"2018-03-25 05:15:40"}

This place is reservation only. Luckily we are here until Monday, we were able to get a Sunday 9:30 pm reservation 1 day in advance. \n\nThe environment and the service were on point. No complaints about that. 2 of us got the set menu with Beef Wellington and Scallops. Oh man, the Scallops were soooooo good! I would say they were the best I had. My friend also got the Lobster Risotto. That was amazing! I wish they had a full-size Lobster Risotto. These two were definitely my highlight of the day. My friend also really liked the Beef Wellington too. The set menu comes with Sticky pudding as dessert. For me, this was way too sweet. It comes with vanilla ice cream. The pudding was much sweeter than the ice cream. I had to eat it with the ice cream to balance out the sweetness. \n\nOverall, Hell's Kitchen was a great experience for us.

Our service that night was great! Our server was courteous, attentive and knowledgeable. 10\/10 for service!\nWe decided to go with one set menu (Scallops, Wellington, Sticky Toffee Pudding), and a la carte items: Seafood Tower, Rack of Lamb, Chocolate cake. \nThere was a very noticeable flavor\/quality difference between the set menu and a la carte options.\n\nStarters:\n- Seafood tower presentation is stunning! Red lights illuminate the ice that cradles the seafood on 3 different perches. Fresh. Briney. No hint of fishy or rubbery seafood. One of the lobster tails however had no meat in it. 8\/10\n\n- Scallops - 5 scallop halves (not full scallops) were a bit disappointing. I'd rather have two full scallops (seared on the outside, velvety on the inside) than a plate that is meant to look plentiful by cutting them in half. But that's just me. Flavor was good but nothing worth raving about. 5\/10\n\nMains:\n- Rack of Lamb - perfectly cooked! Medium Rare. An absolute flavor explosion. The seasoning was not overpowering the delicate lamb and the whip that it was served on is a highlight on its own. 10\/10\n\n- Wellington - such a disappointment! Admittedly, along with the scallops, these two dishes are the highlight of any Gordon Ramsey feature. Don't dare get these wrong. But they did in every way, at least for us. The fact that he's so adamant about his Wellingtons really raises the bar on expectation and, in turn, just highlighted its flaws, all the more! When it arrived it was overcooked (medium\/well, but more well than medium), although we ordered medium\/rare. Secondly it tasted completely unseasoned. No hint of the mustard\/salt\/pepper around the meat. The Parma ham was practically non-existent and flavorless. The pastry did not have any hint of salt sprinkling or flavor. Although the presentation was beautiful, the flavor was so disappointing. 2\/10\n\nDesserts:\nBoth desserts were delicious. The warm sticky toffee did not taste microwaved, as you find with many restaurants. But beware, it's filling and you will want to finish it! So save some room for it. The chocolate cake had a red chocolate pitchfork that was a nice tie in to the overall theme of the restaurant. 8\/10\n\nLast, but certainly not least - Cocktails!\nThese were the highlight (alongside the seafood tower presentation and rack of lamb). \n\n- The Roman Spritz is not just delicious and beautifully presented, but it was perfectly balanced. Presented with two large olives & a rosemary sprig. So good, I wish it were bigger. 9\/10\n\n- Smoke on the Blvd is a showstopper. Served in a whiskey glass with a Hell's Kitchen branded orange rind, it's served in a glass box that is filled with cherrywood smoke. Presented tableside, the server opens the box and the table is quickly enveloped in the aromatic smoke. Great flavor and aromatics! Definitely worth ordering. 10\/10\n\n- Notes from Gordon adds a bit of Gordon humor. The drink itself is mild on the palate and tastes more like a lemonade - perfect for those who do not fancy a strong alcohol punch in their drink. The drink is served with a rolled up note, that has an iconic Gordon Ramsey quote\/insult on it. That night the quote served with the drink was: \"This food is so frozen it just started singing 'Let It Go'\". Lol. Love it. 8\/10\n\nOverall, I would certainly recommend to experience it at least once. The open kitchen with Red\/Blue team chefs and design add a gorgeous flair. \n\nHighlights: Presentation\/Service\/Cocktails\/Lamb\nLet Down: Wellington & Scallops really tanked it.","date":"2018-02-03 04:43:12"}

We would have dined for dinner if we could, but they are fully booked for days. Reserve a table as far in advance as possible!\n\nThe exterior and interior are true to the show, and I love it. From the HK sign on the outside to the pictures of past show winners on the walls, you really feel like you're visiting the actual set. The chefs are even split up into two groups in the open kitchen, dressed in either blue or red to resemble competing teams. If you want some branded show apparel, there are a dozen options by the front doors. \n\nThe menu has several signature \"Hell's Kitchen\" items, such as the beef wellington and lobster risotto. There's a good amount of other options, like avocado toast and oysters on the half shell. There's a fixed lunch set for $60, too -- soup or salad, beef wellington, and  the classic sticky toffee pudding. \n\nWe went with the lobster risotto as an appetizer, split the Hell's Kitchen Burger and fries, and finished with the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Everything was easily 5 out of 5 stars. The risotto was small, but oh so flavorful. The lobster was tender and tasted fresh. The burger was huge and the fries were well-seasoned. The sticky toffee pudding, interestingly enough, doesn't use any chocolate. Nope -- it uses dates(!). I didn't think I'd like it... but I did. I loved it. I can see why just about every table gets this dessert. \n\nIt's not a cheap lunch place, but it's a damn good experience.

If theres one thing you should know (or if you are a TL;DR reader), just know that this place is absolutely great for food, but seriously lacks in service quality. It deserves a very solid 4\/5 stars. \n\nAmbiance\/ atmosphere: \nReally packed, and extremely busy. The overall interior design and views are great. Gives off a nice initial vibe. \n\nFood:\nCame with a party of 3, and ordered 2 set meals (scallops\/ beef wellington\/ toffee pudding), and a crispy skin salmon with mac and cheese side. \n\nThe meal started out with complimentary hummus bites. Really delicious! Though, too little to be savoured. \n\nScallop appetisers. These were great, as I had expected nothing less. (Picture attached. Was missing one scallop, couldn't help myself). \n\nBeef Wellington: \nIt looked much better than it tasted. While the meat was cooked medium rare, it was a bit more cooked than preferred. I always think it's better to cook a bit under, than over. (You can always re-fire an under done wellington, but will always need to dump an overdone one). (Picture attached) \n\nCrispy salmon with mac and cheese side: \nSalmon tasted great, but not rave worthy. The mac and cheese side really gave the scallops a run for it's money. While some may dislike it, as it was swimming in cheese, I think thats the only way to serve it. \n\nSticky Toffee pudding: \nA dish I've actually attempted at making myself. To much surprise, it wasn't very sweet at all. It was leaning towards a more fluffy, unflavoured birthday cake. Probably the least favourite of all.\n\nService: \nService was a real toss-up between poor and great. Our main server seemed very unorganised and walked around a lot. When we were not served our second pudding, we had to flag down our server, as they walked past us. It was very rare that they came by, asking how we were doing. When we let them know about our situation, they were completely oblivious. \n\nHowever, one of the busser's provided us with some of the best service i've seen. They took some time to talk with my group, stop by frequently to see how we were, help us with water refills, and even spent a little bit of time thanking us for dining at HK. They should be the ones that deserve the tips. \n\nOverall impressions: \n\nGreat food, nice looking decor, and great bus-staff.

Lol\n\nOur reservation was at 8, so we arrived a little early. Hell's Kitchen was popping as I expected. We were seated at a table in the center dining room in front the kitchen. I highly recommend that when you make a reservation, you ask to be seated in the area. It is part of the experience. Also, be aware that the noise level is high as well. Not really conducive for conversation, but part of the experience.\n\nThe menu is simple. Pretty much what was cooked on the show is cooked and served here. There is also a prix fix menu, but I recommend staying away from that. You don't get to experience all that Hell's Kitchen has to offer unless you order off the regular menu. Since there was 4 people in my party, that allowed for multiple things to be ordered and shared. \n\nFor starters, we ordered 2 lobster risottos, 1 steak tartare, 1 foie gras.

Based on my experience, I came away with mixed reviews. On the plus side, was the vibrant and comfortable setting. Definitely enjoyed the surroundings and what was happening in the kitchen.  The other plus, was the beef wellington as well as the scallops.  Both were excellent. Now for the down side. Price was definitely on the high side compared to many other upscale restaurants in the area, but what you would expect on the strip. Speaking of prices, was the price of wines. No bottle of wine was less than $50, in addition was the price of wine by the glass. We decided to each have a glass of Melbac for $17 each. I don't mind playing that knowing where I was, but when our waitress poured our wine from the bottle, it was only at 3 ounces at best. When I mentioned that I didn't think that was an adequate pour, she mentioned our method of pouring was two quick pours in the glass .Really?? Definitely would have been better to get a bottle than by the glass. The Lobster Risotto was too salty as other people around us noted the same thing. As for clientele, many were tourist of course, but it would be nice if they dressed accordingly. It was a mixed bag, as most were in shorts and jeans. You don't see that at the Palms, CUT, LAVO, Bouchon or other upscale restaurants. Unfortunately, that is the impression I was left with upon completion of our dinner experience.","date":"2018-02-03 20:25:19"}

This restaurant is more casual. The dress code says business casual, but there were people in flip flops, t-shirts, and sweatpants - really everything. Vegas tends to let everyone in though, but it's good to note you won't be frowned upon for not wearing a nicer outfit. The ambiance was much louder than Gordon Ramsay Steak as well. We found the music playing to be kind of strange, more like what you hear on the radio rather than what you expect at a decently nice restaurant. \n\nThe setup was cool as well with the whole kitchen as an open layout. You could see all the beef wellington's lining up to be served! \nNow for the food. No real complaints here. I have to say I was excited for the bread since he does an excellent job on his bread at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but they don't serve bread here! I was so upset to find this out. Primarily because at Hell's Kitchen the show\/restaurant, they serve a ton of bread. The food we ordered was nice. We had the lobster risotto which was a nice portion and very good. The lobster was excellent, perfectly cooked, and it was cut into pieces which made it easy to eat. We then shared the beef wellington. They like to tell you its small, but we split all of the food among three people, and it was fine. I've always shared the beef wellington and its perfect for when you want to try other dishes as well. Gordon Ramsay can't mess up the beef wellington, it's always perfect. We had the mac and cheese as a side which was super cheesy which I love and had a nice flavor with crispy pancetta. We also had the mushrooms which were good but nothing to brag about.","date":"2018-06-21 00:56:28"}

Our reservation was for 8:30 pm and they definitely held to the reservation time. The place was packed! Immediately upon walking up to the restaurant, that familiar \"HK\" greeted us. My only complaint is that it was not on fire like it is in the show. \n\nWalking into the restaurant, you are greeted by a life-sized Gordon Ramsay on a video screen. Fashioned almost like a news clip reel, he steps out and welcomes you, then walks off screen. Later, he shows up and provides some of his all-time best quotes from the show. This area is a decent sized lobby where you can also look at merchandise to purchase while you wait. Because we had our kids with us, we opted to not wait in the bar area. While waiting, you can enjoy the photo wall of all of the past winners of Hell's Kitchen.\n\nAt 8:30 we were seated, about 3\/4 of the way back, yet centered. Although not an exact replica of the HK television restaurant, they definitely nailed this one! The two kitchens in their famous red and blue colors stood out, as did the chefs, donning the well-known red and blue jackets, who were working behind the pass. Executive chef and Season 17 Winner, Michelle Tribble was sporting the white jacket and running the pass.\n\nThe plates on the table had classy grey napkins with the Hell's Kitchen logo stitched on them. Every detail in the restaurant was well-planned and executed.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ordered the Prix Fixe menu, starring the pan seared scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. This is, by far, the best deal when ordering. The kids ordered the brick-pressed chicken, a caesar salad, and mac and cheese. Just to be the awesome dad, I ordered the lobster risotto and shrimp scampi flambe.\n\nTo start with, the lobster risotto was amazing! The lobster was so sweet and moist. The flavor and texture of the risotto was perfect! The only complaint I had was that the risotto was definitely not the same size as the appetizers on the show. It was more like a thin coating on the plate, with a perfect lobster tail set on top.\n\nHonestly, I only ordered the shrimp so the girls could see their first flambe. I was so wrong to order them for that reason. They were cooked to perfection and the flavor....I did not even need to worry about the drawn butter that accompanied them. Utter perfection. I only wish there was more than three. Those little suckers cost $8.00 a piece!\n\nNext came the scallops. They were seared perfectly and the sauce that accompanied them was delicious. Because of the way they were cut, they were easy to share around the table as samples for all of us.\n\nYou simply cannot come to Hell's Kitchen and NOT order the beef wellington. This is the first time I have ever had wellington and I was always skeptical. My girlfriend has had it several times and loves it. The meat was cooked perfectly! The demi-glace added a subtle, yet noticeable touch. The puree and root vegetables were seasoned well and a perfect addition to the plate. (again, I just wish there was more).\n\nMy girls loved, loved, loved, the brick-pressed chicken. I was able to sample it and was very impressed. It is very easy to dry out a chicken breast. This was so tender, moist, and well-seasoned I almost wished that I had ordered it. I was glared by one of the kids at as I sampled the mac and cheese appetizer. Everything from the cheese and pasta, to the seasoning and crust was amazing.\n\nI know I am over-using the word amazing, but it just was. Now, admittedly, I am a huge fan of the show and walking into this place automatically creates a bias. Have we had better food? Sure. However, this was extremely good and a well-thought-out menu. Here, the food coupled with the experience are what makes it so special. The vibe in the place is absolutely electric and the server was personable, attentive, and entertaining. For the amount of customers and the fast-paced ambiance of the restaurant, we never felt rushed and almost seemed encouraged to take our time.\n\nI don't get to Vegas often, but I will make sure and return to Hell's Kitchen when I go there again. It is expensive and loud and.... I loved every minute. Well done!","date":"2018-03-06 03:26:38"}

The best thing on the plate were probably the carrots underneath the chicken. For dessert we got the sticky toffee pudding which was very delectable! The wagyu meatballs were also good, but the scallops were not worth it for the price and you only get 2 1\/2 as they split it into halves. Overall I wished the menu was the same for lunch, but I guess I understand why they limit the lunch menu. As for the entree I chose, it needs more flavor in terms of the chicken itself.

We made reservations ahead of time as I'm a huge foodie and love checking out the newest places. Mind you, I have never seen the tv show nor do I know any of the signature dishes so the whole experience was based on everything presented.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the strip, just outside of Caesars Palace. The decor is really nice and I love the atmosphere. We checked in with the hostess and were seated right away. Within a minute or two a server approached us with the menus and took our drink orders. I explained to him that I had never seen the show and would love suggestions on the menu. He explained all very thoroughly. \n\nWe both decided on the tasting menu as the waiter described it having three of Gordon Ramsey's signature dishes. Within minutes we were also served an extra course compliments of the chef.\n\nThe first course that was compliments of the chef was garlic hummus in a pastry (I forgot the actual name). Next within minutes the appetizers were served. I ordered the scallops as they were recommended but also tried out the caesar salad. The scallops were beautifully presented and tasted even better than their appearance. The salad had garlic croutons which added an extra touch. \n\nFor the entree, apparently the Beef Wellington is the most popular dish and that is the only entree available with the tasting menu. I had never tried Beef Wellington before but this blew my mind! The taste is incredible with all the right ingredients and spices. I enjoyed the side dishes being light as the entree itself was pretty heavy. \n\nNext came time for the dessert. When I first read the name - sticky toffee pudding I was very unimpressed. However the dessert was nothing like what I thought it was going to be. It was like heaven in the mouth! Honestly probably one of the BEST desserts I have ever eaten in my life! The ice cream, the flavors, just everything was so perfect! I would honestly come back for just this dessert.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this restaurant and I hope to eat here again in the future. Everything from the service to the decor to the food was beyond amazing. I love the open kitchen as well and being able to watch everything. One of my new favorite restaurants in Vegas!\n\nUpdate - Came back for lunch to try out the burgers and because I was craving the dessert again. The Hells Kitchen burger is fully stacked and quite spicy. My companion had his mouth on fire even though he loves spicy food. It was quite entertaining to watch. The signature burger I ordered was deliciously made as well and comes with a secret sauce. Both burgers are accompanied with french fries and come with dipping sauces. As always the sticky toffee pudding for dessert was heaven in my mouth. \n\nHighly recommend coming here for both lunch and dinner!","date":"2018-01-25 08:21:46"}

The service is impeccable. Since this restaurant is a little more on the high end, be prepared to pay the price of a usual celebrity chef's restaurant prices. I was here with a friend, and the bill came out to around $200 for the both of us.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful with the small tiles of the red and blue kitchen with the open kitchen so you can see the chefs at work right in front of you\n\nIt is not a very large menu but it is enough for you to think that it will be special. It's not like the TV show because you do not hear any screaming from Ramsey... although, that would be pretty cool. \n\nIt was a wonderful experience.

Front desk hostess very professional. Ordered the Beef Wellington that was not up to par, something you could get at Denny's. Lobster risotto had four pieces of lobster and they were tiny and rubbery. No lobster flavor. Scallops cut in half and not fresh. Smeared potatoes on plate were very cold. When we mentioned our disappointment the wait staff said \"oh sorry\" but no effort to make us feel like they really cared.  We visited on June 24th 2018 at 9:15. Four of us all agreed about the above review. We will not be going back or referring any friends or family to this place. I've lost all respect for Ramsey. Everything took awhile to get, including the bill.  Super bummer considering how much my friends love all the Ramsey shows.

That pretty much sums up my visit here. I have always wanted to try Gordon Ramsay's famous beef wellington and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. I thought the ambiance here would be a little more formal but you could wear more casual clothing. Maybe because went early in the day (around 230). The kitchen is full view and set up like the show.  You have your red and blue jackets cooking away this amazing beef wellington, or whatever else you have ordered.\nI had the Prix fixe menu which came with seared scallops or Cesar salad, I chose the salad, beef wellington, and a sticky toffee pudding. In hindsight, I should've had the scallops. The salad was just an average salad. It was good but nothing spectacular. Then comes the highlight of the meal. The beef wellington. Served with root vegetables and potato puree. Cooked medium, it was so tender and melt in your mouth. Flaky puff pastry that is so buttery, and crispy. I'm drooling.\nThe sticky pudding was also to die for. Served a la mode with speculoos ice cream. Yummy. For a cocktail I had the Notes from Gordon. It's a gin cocktail that comes with a snarky note in true Gordon fashion. This was also delicious. I would definitely be back here if I'm in Vegas again.","date":"2018-02-12 17:25:42"}

I have to say that whilst the meal was pretty good, I was slightly disappointed. (A picture & tweet was sent to Gordon Ramsay) - For having a reservation, our wait to be seated was essentially nonexistent. It probably helped that we came slightly early. \n\nMOMENT OF TRUTH: So as it turns out, after being seated and having a really, really wonderful host & server, putting in our orders, it takes 45+mins for appetizers to even come out. Good thing we ordered drinks. Eventually, the food did start coming out. *** seared scallops, beef wellington, and dessert were part of the pre-fixe menu. \n\nDrinks: \nFear & Loathing: A nice sweet smokey drink with Mezcal & various citrus fruits. \nNote from Gordon: A really good drink to have on a hot summer day btw, made with gin, tea, lemongrass, peach & lemon. It's like an adult's lemonade. Also comes with a \"note from Gordon\" which is a nice touch.\n\nFood: \n-Tuna Tartare: It honestly was eaten so fast after I had taken a photo due to a table of 6 very hungry adults - I didn't get to eat ANY. :( I heard it was good though. \n-Pan Seared Scallops: Plated around the plate were the scallops on top of a celery root puree, topped with chives - they were good, not overcooked and chewy which definitely lives up to the restaurant's rep. Middle of the plate were the bacon lardons & pickled granny smith apples - which again, I didn't get to eat because it was all gone right after the picture. \n-Seared Foie Gras: Unfortunately, the foie gras wasn't just seared. It was cooked for so long it lost it's flavor. The outside was definitely overdone & hard whereas the inside with whatever moisture left in it kept it from feeling like biting into crispy bacon. I was looking forward to this A LOT. \n-Beef Wellington: The pastry on the outside was crispy and had a crunch when bitten into while the meat on the inside was perfectly cooked and moist. It was tender and juicy. The potato puree & vegetables with the red wine glace helped cut the meal. It didn't feel too heavy - instead it was a good amount to still be able to walk out and continue the night!\n-Braised Short Rib -x2!: within 6 people, we ordered 2 orders & mine with sauteed spinach (I just can't eat the creamy polenta). It was a little bit more on the salty side which I assume the creamy polenta would help since the spinach was basically drowning in it. I'd still order it again - I just love trying different braised short ribs. \n-Roasted Rack of Lamb: I normally don't eat lamb due to fear of excessive gaminess but I have to say that it was not like that here. Yes, there is gaminess but not to the point where I'd need to switch seats at the table (and yes, that has happened before). \n\n\n** Overall, food was okay! Not something I'd praise and tell people to go try. I'll definitely try other restaurants of Gordon's in the future but overall it was not a memorable experience.","date":"2018-05-01 02:44:18"}

The first was a bit disappointing, with a soggy pastry and a non-existent duxelles layer. Or was there supposed to be any? I'm not quite sure, but I suppose the prix fixe is menu was worth a try. The pumpkin soup was flavorful with the spicy chorizo (which I swear has star anise in it), though the chorizo was a little too burnt. The beef wellington, as I mentioned above, was disappointing. I think the fillet was a bit undercooked, along with the puff pastry that was just plain soggy. I would not say it was made the Gordon way. The mash potatoes were also just whatever, but at least the presentation was nice. The eggs in purgatory were surprisingly delicious, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like tomatoes. The spicy tomato sauce (with mint?) was surprisingly flavorful and left me wanting more. Too bad it's such an expensive dish for what it is. On the other hand, the lobster risotto was undercooked (hard rice grains = big no no), and the medium burger was well done. The sticky toffee pudding was, however, amazing, and despite how sweet (and a good portion) it was, we finished it between two people. It was warm, moist, and just the right amount of toffee. It was not as \"sticky\" as I had imagined, like other versions, but it was oooh ooh delicious! I highly recommend trying the sticky toffee pudding, if nothing else. They were also generous and gave us a complimentary one for our birthday lady.\n\nI love the art deco and modern ambience at this restaurant, with big windows looking out onto the strip, along with the suspender uniforms that their servers wear. I did not, however, like the over 30 minute wait for our food... Maybe it's because they haven't gotten a good system down because it's a new restaurant, but they really need to get on their service and even their cooking. I was hoping since this place is new, their chefs would be the designated experienced ones, but I hate to say, I don't know if I would come back.","date":"2018-02-12 23:25:02"}

If you love the show don't even think about not going. Finally a pro-tip; if you don't have a reservation you can sit at the bar and eat but space is limited.","date":"2018-05-31 00:37:29"}

We were seated for about 10min before we were given water then another 10min went by before the  Buser asked if our waiter had been by yet, because she told him twice we were seated...still no menu or waiter...then he finally shows up with no Apology for the delay and jumps right into our order. We ordered several items: appetizers, soup, salad, entrees ect... to which the server said \"thats a ton of food are you sure?! ...ummm yeah we are sure that's why we are ordering it..then EVERYTHING came piling out at the same time....no pace to the meal what so ever, so things were cold from sitting there before we even could get to them. The fear and loathing drink was undrinkable because it tasted like burnt charcoal...I understand \"smokey\", but it was totally over done...I let our waiter know to which he responded oh I'll let management know...but nothing came of that of course.

Quite a fan of the TV show so I was excited when I heard they opened a kitchen in LV. \n\nBe sure to make your reservations weeks\/months in advance. The weekends fill up quickly. It was tough for me because Vegas is always an unplanned trip so it was hard to find an open spot. \n\nThe only reservation available for my party was a Sunday night at 10:45PM. Boy was this late. \n\nAnyway, arrived at 10:30ish and had to wait a little. We got walked to our table at 10:55. The place is pretty awesome. It's really cool how they try to mirror the TV show's kitchen and it's overall appearance. We also saw Michelle Tribble working the kitchen so that was a plus. \n\nOur reservation was really late so this was a midnight snack for us. We had dinner before so we weren't starving by the time we arrived. \n\nOrdered: \nHK Signature Prix Fixe Menu - Comes with scallops as appetizer, the beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding as dessert. Great dish if you've never tried Gordon Ramsay's wellington before, although for some reason, I think my first time having it at The London (in West Hollywood) was better. Maybe I wasn't hungry or the first cut (or time) is always the deepest, but this was still a good dish. \n\nLobster Risotto - A small and quaint appetizer dish. Lobster is fresh AF but small. \n\nRack of Lamb - I don't think I have had lamb this good and tender before. I was afraid medium rare would be too rare and have a gamy taste\/smell but it did not! My family also enjoyed this dish. \n\nMy family of four shared all of this as a 4th meal and we were stuffed before the end. You may want to check with your server first if you are sharing the Prix Fixe meal because they have to get \"chef's approval\" or something. We told our server we had dinner before this because we couldn't wait till 11:30PM-12AM to eat. \n\nGlad I was able to experience Hell's Kitchen, LV.

She is not a HUGE fan of the show, but she likes Gordon Ramsay; she thinks he's funny, so I made reservations not really knowing too much about it.\n\nWe initially ordered the prawn flambe appetizer, but our waiter (thankfully) had informed me that there were only 3 prawns, so we changed it to the scallops at my son's request. There were six scallops for $22. I'm not cheap but seriously, to me that's nuts. To us, the scallops were OK. \n\nThere were four of us, my daughter ordered the salmon, my husband ordered the rack of lamb, my son ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the braised short rib. The presentation for all of them was nice. The speed at which we received our orders was efficient. Temperature was great. The food servers in grey got confused with two of our orders. Two of them with two plates in hand, first both approached our table, gave us two orders and the other girl wandered around the restaurant with the other two plates and then ended up back where she started. Don't know what happened there, but no big deal - just thought it was weird.\n\nMy son loved his filet mignon - medium rare. I tried it and it was perfect. Perfect size too. I would definitely recommend it. My braised short rib was perfect in terms of portion and the flavors were perfect. The texture was just too mushy for me. My husband's rack of lamb was cooked perfectly, and I thought it went perfectly dipped in the sauce from my short rib ;) My daughter's salmon was perfectly crispy and cooked well, nothing exceptional there though. I would definitely say the preparation, quality and flavoring of the food was wonderful. The value was sufficient as well. Except for the damn appetizer lol. Now that I think about it, maybe if the scallops were presented in a different way, it might have been more appealing to me, just thinking out loud here.\n\nThe things I thought were a little odd (and I say this as a Hell's Kitchen \"outsider\") is that there is a kitchen that is supposedly a replica of the kitchen in the show. We got a really good seat right in front of the open kitchen...but, it almost felt like we were waiting for something to happen and nothing happened. It was just a regular functioning kitchen, nothing to see here. So it was kind of weird. Maybe it was just us, but the way it was set up, I almost felt like there was something that was worth watching and there wasn't.\n\nI have to point out our server Miguel was very nice and very helpful with the appetizer recommendations. The girls in red however (the hostesses?), need to be consistently friendly. I watched their interactions with people since we waited quite a long time to be seated, and also I was interested to see if it was just us they were cold towards. They are the types of girls that are only nice to certain people, so good luck with that. I can't tell you WHAT kind lol - just that they were not nice to everyone...not cool!\n\nI almost forgot one more very important oversight (in my opinion) and that is, there is NO SEATING in the lobby...none! Standing room only, not good. We waited about 45 minutes and reading some of these reviews, that wait time seems to be the average.\n\nIt was good for my daughter to experience for her birthday and I'm very glad we went - she even got to see Gordon Ramsay himself that day, I thought that was a nice surprise for her :) And of course we had to buy her a $30 tshirt (insert eye roll here lol).\n\nI don't plan on coming back as here in Vegas we are so lucky and spoiled to have so many amazing dining options and this was just ok to me. But I think for a group visiting from out of town, or a celebration of some sort for people that are huge fans of the show, it's probably much cooler of an experience.\n\nOne last thing that I felt important to mention. I made this reservation via Open Table and in the special requests section I had asked if they could bring out the sticky toffee pudding at the end of the meal for my daughter's birthday and they did :) Without discussing it in person with anyone, so that was really nice. And even though I'm a strictly chocolate dessert lover (for the most part) that dessert lived up to the hype!","date":"2018-02-13 22:57:32"}

We (3) were there to see Celine Dion at Caesars and thought this would be a great place to have dinner prior to seeing her show. From having no bread available on each table to the worst combination of spices \"plated\" into each food dish we tried, it was all BAD. The wait was excessively long, too, just to be served inedible food.  I ordered the chicken (plain) because I do not like spicy food and paid an exorbitant amount of money for a piece of plain chicken that was the size a small pond frog. There was nothing else served with the chicken so it looked really awkward \"plated\"...... I say plated because they make such a big deal saying that you food is being plated. It's a stupid way of saying your food is about to be ready.  My daughter ordered the chicken dish also from the menu (with the spices) and ate one bite and just left the rest. We wound up going to a Vegas convenience store right after dinner and bought Pop Tarts just to fill us up before seeing the show. In all the years we have been going to Vegas and all the top 5-star restaurants we have sampled and have come to enjoy, this is the first Vegas FLOP we have dined at.

We are 4 Californian women and Influencers, with Southeast Asian and African American descent, we are a huge fan of your shows. \nWe reserved a table one week prior to celebrate my birthday. We were given a choice at 10:45pm or 11pm and opted for the 10:45. Saturday came, we all dressed up nice and was very excited and looking forward for the grand experience at your restaurant. We were running late, as you know, traffic at the strip is terrible at any given time. \nWe called to make sure we don't lose our reservation, was put on hold by a gentleman as we literally were running to make it in time and got there at exactly 11pm. Your hostess was not very accomodating, told us they only reserve spots for 15min tops and said they close the kitchen at 11pm. It was 11:01 and from there I was already turned off by how we were treated. How is the kitchen close at 11pm when you initially gave us a choice of 11pm reservation time? So, she called the manager to see if we can still be seated. We waited patiently, then the lady manager came with Security. Yes, Mr. Gordon Ramsay, your SECURITY was standing there like he has no idea why he was there. I felt so emabarrased by what they were doing. My friend was still trying to make sense of our reservation, explaining that they could have given us atleast a minute consideration. And instead of arguing for 20 more minutes, they could have seated us and let us celebrate. They rejected us without apology, with no option or any kind of courtesy. Not even kind words. They wouldn't even give us the general manager's business card. I've never felt more humiliated and discriminated at a restaurant or any public place for that matter. Of all the nice restaurants in Vegas, we picked yours. Because we thought we are going to have the best experience, unfortunately, it was the worst! Felt like 1950's all over again. I still cannot believe that this thing still exist! Your name is your brand.. Gordon Ramsey, you surely did not build this empire from scratch so that people who work for you, who literally does not care about your vision can just easily ruin everything by being unprofessional and discriminating. I am completely appalled and will never go to any of your restaurant again, I will share our story to all our family and friends and all the people I know, and even to strangers. I will blog to all relevant sites and forums and tell them about our horrible experience.. Until your employees learn to treat people equally, with decency and respect and realize the value of humanity. I wonder, where is the love in your food???","date":"2018-08-07 06:13:55"}

We entered and gave our reservation to the hostesses (three of them sat at the counter with unfriendly vibes, no smiles, young, and no experience). We had to wait in a roped off line for our reservation to be ready and there were no places to sit (which I didn't like because girls like to wear heels when they're gonna go out and splurge on a nice $200+ meal). We were sat in the bar area at a high top which didn't feel like the dining room. The atmosphere felt like a cafeteria. It was checkered flooring and the lighting was too bright. The cheapest wine was $18 and so we looked to purchase a bottle since you can usually get more bang for your buck but the cheapest bottle was something like $70! For appetizers we ordered the seared scallops and the lobster risotto. After they came out we took one bite of each dish and immediately said them back because they were lukewarm. They came out after another 10 minutes and they were warmed up slightly we decided not to send them back again. The risotto was great but it could've used more salt (seemed to be a trend during our meal) and the scallops were nothing special. I ordered the short ribs and my husband ordered the beef Wellington. I wanted to order the short ribs so we could try something else on the menu because I already knew the beef Wellington would be great from the reviews. The short rib came out I took one bite and sent it back. It was the land, had no salt, and was burned. The polenta had absolutely no flavor and was actually a little watery. When I sent it back I requested the beef Wellington as a replacement. It came out within 5 minutes but I still needed salt. My husband love the dish as is and didn't think he needed the salt so maybe it was just me but I still needed it. My husband ordered the pre fixe menu so it came with dessert. The dessert on the menu was the sticky toffee putting with cookie butter ice cream on top. This was the only dish that we saw coming out of the kitchen even though the waiter said that they had a full menu of other dessert options. We took one bite and look at each other and said that this was one of the best dessert we've ever had in our lives. The size was huge and could definitely fill a table of four but we easily and happily ate it just the two of us. This was definitely the highlight of the night because everything else seem to be a flop. When the bill came the waiter didn't take anything off the bill which we were very surprised because we had to return to appetizers and a main course. The waiter merely said I hope we resolve the issue with the replaced beef Wellington. For a restaurant to be viewed as a finer dining establishment both my husband and I were somewhat surprised that they didn't accommodate taking off and entrée item. We were very disappointed and it seemed like this restaurant was really created only to capitalize on the name of health kitchen and not the culinary truth fine dining experience we thought it would be. I honestly can't believe Gordon Ramsay has back this restaurant with his name because if he had actually gone to the restaurant and monitor the activities of what was going in and out of the kitchen I'm sure he would be highly upset and it wouldn't have been up to his standards. To be brutally honest this restaurant should be named kitchen nightmares and not Hells kitchen.","date":"2018-02-25 22:00:07"}

I went here yesterday for my anniversary and lucked out with a window view. The food was fantastic. Exactly what I expected. We got the lobster risotto, scallops, and a short rib grilled cheese. The food is the reason I would go back. There were a couple issues I thought about. One was that service was veryyyy slow. I wished there was a bread or cracker they would give you in between. If not, I atleast wished they would check on you and update you on your meal. The other issue was that, for the short rib grilled cheese. It came to our table with no meat or onions. What was odd is that you could see small bits of meat so you could tell it was on the sandwich and then they took it off.  We had to send it back and get it remade. When we did, they said that the kitchen read our order that specified no pork in our meals as no meat so he took it off. My huge concern with that is that if I did have a meat allergy, intolerance, or preference, the kitchen tried to serve me a sandwich with meat bits on it without remaking one. This was bad kitchen etiquette and I know Chef Ramsay would never allow that. Thankfully it was delicious.  \n\nThe atmosphere was great and I loved that there was a red and blue kitchen like the show. \n\n\nI will probably go back but I hope that service picks up.","date":"2018-02-13 21:36:53"}

Unfortunately for us, all the dinner reservations were taken, so I settled for a lunch reservation. (***Reservations are highly suggested!) Checking in with the hostesses was a breeze. We waited less than 5 minutes for a table. The waiting area was lined with pictures of the past winners from the seasons of Hell's Kitchen - something fun to look at while you wait. \n\nOn the walk to our table, the hostess walked us by the kitchen. It's an open concept, so you can watch all the chefs cook while you dine if you're lucky enough to get a table nearby! We were seated near the window, looking out onto the strip - also a fantastic view. \n\nWe were greeted by our server who was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the menu as she gave us a quick rundown on all the favorite items. \n\n1) Pan Seared Scallops - A must! Five scallops total so I suggest you savor each bite. Totally worth the $$. \n2) Brick Pressed Chicken - The skin was sooo crispy and delicious. Surprisingly, the chicken was extremely juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato hash was a nice touch and complemented the chicken well. \n3) Express 3-Course Lunch Menu - My boyfriend started out with the Pumpkin Soup. It was surprisingly refreshing and not overly sweet. He chose the Beef Wellington for the main course since it's one of Ramsay's staples. We've never had one before, or anything similar, so it was definitely good to try. The beef was cooked well and who doesn't like puff pastry!? I'm also pretty sure there was some pate in between the beef and puff pastry, which I assume is standard for this dish, but we weren't really fans. \n4) Sticky Toffee Pudding - Honestly, this might have been the star of the show. This was included in the 3-course meal, but I would definitely purchase this even if it wasn't. One word: AMAZING. Each bite was so rich and warm, and paired with a little bit of ice cream... you couldn't go wrong! \n\nThere were some hit and misses with our experience, but I would definitely return. I will say that service is a little slow though. I saw a lot of tables just sitting on their phones waiting for their checks. We had to ask for water and iced tea refills, so that was a bummer, especially when there were bussers helping the servers with refills and such. \n\nIt's definitely a great experience getting to taste the plates you see on TV, so I highly suggest stopping by at least once. We already have dinner reservations for our next visit just for the Sticky Toffee Pudding! :)","date":"2018-02-25 10:53:46"}

Which day better to go, than my birthday??  But oh wait, the news has said since its recent opening, there have been 12,000 reservations.  I'd ought to make one.  For my day, the last available is at 2:45 in the afternoon (-_-) late lunch I guess... Weird too because when we were there, more than half the tables were open.  So maybe if you're strolling by, they'll probably take walk-ins too.\n\nThe place is gorgeous.  A giant clean open room with lots of head space by a high ceiling.  The decor and the server uniforms make me feel like I'm in an old bank from the 1930's or something.  Hell's Kitchen would not be complete without the iconic open-kitchen as in the TV show.  Though the staff and decor shows the Red and Blue teams, there is no competition here - it's obvious they're all working together.  Speaking of Red & Blue teams, the restrooms, the men's sink counter is lit blue while my friend told me the women's sinks are lit red.  Hmm...\n\nDavid was our server and was super nice.  He wore a smile through the whole experience and even shared great info - like the fact that we were there for the lunch service and need to come back at dinner for the rack of lamb.  Heck yeah.  But I came to Hell's Kitchen for one thing: Gordon's signature Beef Wellington.  To our knowledge, this is only available during lunch as part of the 3-course option (it's only available as an individual entree during dinner), so the 3-course we went. ($60; $95 with win pairing)\n\nIt started with a caesar salad or pumpkin soup (we got one of each and both were superb).  The salad, so simple but so good.  The soup, with a hint of spice, the creaminess goes down so smooth.  And then here comes the wellington... I gotta say... this is where I knocked off one star.  The bready crust was great, the vegetables were nice and moist, but the beef... it was drier than I anticipated.  Though it didn't meet my expectation, it was overall a good meal - and it didn't end there.  That toffee pudding dessert, a warm sticky cake with sweet ice cream was like crack!  I devoured it and soon after started very getting sleepy.  lol\n\nI really enjoyed this spot and coming in for lunch only made me hungry for dinner.  Hopefully I'll get a chance at the lobster risotto and the rack of lamb - both of which Gordon was always slamming his fist and cursing the cooks for not getting perfect - it's gotta be good.","date":"2018-02-14 17:12:54"}

The strange thing is that it was very easy to change the original reservation from 2 to 4 a few days before, then a last minute change to 7. Some tables were empty at 5:20pm on this Saturday so I suppose it really isn't as bad now as it was when they inaugurated. \n\n1- Wagyu Meatballs $18. Nothing especial about this except it was too salty and heavy to be an appetizer. Too cheesy and greasy for my liking and the wagyu part, couldn't tell.\n\n2- Lobster Risotto $24. The lobster was great, fresh and slightly raw inside which made it taste like sashimi. The rice was not as flavorful as expected. It was almost like a pile of yellow congee.\n\n3- Beef Wellington $49. Much better than the beef wellington at Gordon Ramsay Steak. The pastry wasn't mushy and the beef tender to an impossible tenderness. Unfortunately it was a tad too salty and it needed much more sauce to accompany each cut. \n\n4- Wild Mushrooms $9. Terrible. Oily and flavorless. I am pretty sure they forgot to season this. \n\n5- Sticky Toffee Pudding $9. Incredible! even better than GR Steaks' which is a little different.

I will have to say though that the most delicious and unique tasting dish was the potato purée ($9), I highly recommend you get this dish the price point is crazy good especially when comparing it to the exquisite flavor.","date":"2018-09-06 04:57:47"}

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful but unless you sit in the main dining room, where you can see the chefs cook you will miss the experience. Our table however was located way in the back in a separate section, a long ways from the kitchen and the view of the kitchen happenings. The music playing was way too loud for the space. Had a hard time hearing our waiter as well as the people I was with. The food was tasty but no more tasty then any other fine dining spaces in Vegas. \nThe meals we had included Beef Wellington, which was good but the chunk of beef had a ton of gristle in it. Smoked Golden Beets salad, Braised short rib, Filet  mignon w bearnaise. The bearnaise sauce seemed like an odd sauce for the steak. Sugar Snap Pea's which our whole party devoured along with Potato Gratin. We finished dinner with a Sticky Toffee Pudding which in fact wasn't pudding but more a dense cake w a scoop of ice cream on top & a very interesting pineapple desert served over dry ice. All in all, dinner was fine but was Way More Hype then anything. You could find a better meal for same price anywhere on the strip and have a more pleasant dining experience.","date":"2018-05-31 19:30:58"}

We each ordered the prix fixe meal consisting of scallops, beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding. I added the wine pairing which I count as the single most ridiculous way of losing $50, and that's including slot machine play. The first course scallops were incredible, but unfortunately, they were the only part of the meal that tasted as though they were prepared by professional chefs. Our waiter asked if he should bring my second glass of wine (for $50, I would expect what I consider 3 full glasses of wine, all three glasses here equaled the equivalent of what I consider one glass of wine). I told him he could bring the wine, not realizing it would be another 40 minutes until our second course arrived. Our beef wellington was overwhelmed by overcooked phyllo dough and really quite bland. The surrounding vegetables were flavorless, hard knobs. One of us had an order of scalloped potatoes and they were completely under-seasoned. I left most of my second dish untouched. The sticky toffee pudding was exceedingly rich, I had a few bites and pushed it aside. Our waiter then brought out my third wine pairing (seems he forgot about us) and explained that this would be only a 2 oz dessert wine pairing. Overall, we were incredibly disappointed by this meal and we spent over $400 between the three of us (and I was the only one who added alcohol to the meal). We would absolutely not return.

It was great to show up and beat the line that's waiting there. I didn't see the wait times for anyone but I didn't need to since they sat us right away. \n\nThe view was nice at our 2 person table and the decor pleasant. Where we were seated, we couldn't see the cooks so that was unfortunate. It is setup to replicate the show experience so I think sitting near the cooks puts you more into that full immersion if that's what you are desiring. \n\nThe food:\n\nThis is where it hurts. I really wanted to like the food. My wife took me here for my birthday and we are huge fans of the show and Gordon Ramsey. So when our Lobster Risotto and White Asparagus soup came out, I was expecting food bliss. What we got was small portions of bland, undercooked food. I kept eating the risotto thinking, \"What is this missing? Why is it so crunchy?\" I finally asked for salt and it made the taste better. But the salt wasn't going to help it being undercooked. The lobster was ok. Nothing miraculous. Nothing horrible. Just...ok. I think there in lies a problem. Why is a $24 item on the menu only partially ok? The soup was bland as well. Salt improved the dish putting it at a resounding ok dish as well. \n\nBeef Wellington. I was looking forward to this with lowered expectations (due to the last course) and it was....ok as well. The meat was cooked to a nice medium rare but it felt and tasted like it was mass produced (which it had to have been since everyone was ordering it). There was a white purée to the side which was good. It was seasoned so it made it stand out. The vegetables however were an after thought. It's like someone said, \"Oh crap, put some carrots on there. You don't need to cook them, just throw em some hot water so they feel warm and out then on the plate.\" They were hard and not satisfying at all. \n\nMy wife had some potatoes gratin which were not seasoned at all. At this point, we had a small jar of salt that the waiter had brought over (we asked for it). I was confused on how he didn't ask about the food at all. Just kept asking if he could assist us with anything. I felt like I was cutting my meat like a pro so I wasn't sure what assistance he could provide. \n\nDessert time. And finally something good came. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was great. Not necessarily life changing, but it was genuinely really good. It was the only thing I'd order again and eat. The portion was very generous as well. We also got the Chocolate Cake which was ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. Just....ok. \n\nLastly, the ambience. First of all, it was loud. From the music to the acoustics, it was hard to have a conversation. The waiter was trying to talk to us about the menu and we couldn't hear him at all. We enjoyed a friendly game of \"What do you think he said?\" everytime he came by to talk to us. \n\nLastly, there was this lady who would not stop screaming. Apparently she just....won a billion dollars or got married or divorced (depending on your perspective of life). Either way, she would not stop screeching for joy. It was ruining the dinner experience. So what did the staff do? Nothing meaningful. The Assistant Manager finally came over to the table and told them, \"Hey guys. You should be happy and joyful. Go for it!\" We didn't think that was super effective. And we were right. She kept screeching. Tables were getting visibly upset. The only reason any of the screeching stopped was because they left. \n\nWe paid our bill (around $150 with tip) and then asked to speak to someone about our experience. The waiter was happy to hear our critiques and was very kind. I'd like to think we were very kind to him as well. We talked about our food and our thoughts. He said he'd pass it on to the kitchen. We also shared our displeasure with how the Asst. Manager handled the screeching lady. The waiter listened to us and said he'd pass it along. The waiter did try and do something to comp us for our bad experience but we didn't want that to impact our critique. We were happy to pay full price if only so they would take our criticism to heart. \n\nUnfortunately, we will never be returning to this establishment. The only thing I'm thankful for is that I am no longer curious about how anything tastes. For that, I am grateful.","date":"2018-06-28 04:50:39"}

His assistant (I didn't get his name but shout out to Derek's assistant on Saturday 2\/10\/18!) was very good as well, very prompt in refilling our waters and taking away plates we were finished with. The food came out promptly and evenly spaced between courses. One slight negative, our drinks took a bit, but as it was a very busy Saturday night and the bar was packed, this could be forgiven. On to the specifics on the food! \n\nAppetizers - My girlfriend had the Caesar Salad. It was okay overall, the dressing wasn't as strong as a Caesar typically is but the lettuce was very crisp and fresh, the croutons were good and the pieces of fried cheese were a nice touch. I had the pan seared scallops and they were very good. Cooked very well and very flavorful. Would definitely recommend. \n\nMain course - My girlfriend had the Braised Short rib. It was delicious. It was so perfectly cooked and the meat was melt in your mouth good. Outstanding. I had the Beef Wellington and oh my, I can see why this is Gordon's famous dish. It was perfect. Beef was perfectly mid rare. The pastry shell was perfectly cooked. The mushroom pate was even good and I typically don't like mushrooms. We also had the Mac and Cheese side and it was so delicious! If you like Mac and Cheese you will not regret ordering it. \n\nDessert - We shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. Amazing! Best part of the meal for sure. It was so delicious and the Speculoos ice cream on top was an excellent twist on this famous British dessert. \n\nOverall we had an outstanding time at Gordon's newest restaurant and would definitely recommend for not only people who are fans of Gordon but for anyone who wants an outstanding meal.

I have wanted to try the seared scallops and beef wellington that I have craved since season 1.

I built up what I hoped the food would taste like for so long that I was afraid I would be disappointed, but to my surprise, the food was as good as I have always imagined. When the waiters came to take my plates, they were so clean that you would think I liked them clean. And trust me, I considered it. Even the sticky toffee pudding ended up being one of the best deserts I have ever had. I got to try some of my friends' foods and can say the lamb and mac n cheese were equally just as amazing. The cheesecake was very pretty but was only okay. \n\nWhether you are a fan of the show or not, the food will not disappoint!

Hell's Kitchen is playing on the TV, there's an open kitchen with chefs wearing blue and red team uniforms. \n\nI was starting to wonder about the timing of the service, but my server explained that I caught them between lunch and dinner, which is why it took a little bit longer. I appreciated the explanation so I wasn't wondering where my food was.\n\nI got the pre fixe scallops, beef Wellington, and toffee pudding. Even though I came at an odd time, my server Mike made sure the timing on the service was perfect, so the entree came right after the appetizer, and same for the dessert.\n\nThe scallops were tasty with a great soft texture, and the celery compote salad was served warm. It tasted great.\n\nThen the beef wellington came-- perfectly done on the inside and with a flaky pastry. But midway through eating it, my stomach started feeling funny. I hadn't eaten anything since 9am in the morning, and the only other thing I'd had before this was the scallops. I kept ignoring the rumblings since they were coming and going, so I hoped they would go away. I finally had to rush to the bathroom after I finished my wellington, which took a while for me to finish. \n\nOmg. It was that not the good kind of bathroom experience.

So I was skeptical of coming here when my husband suggested it.    It took over Serendipity outside of Caesar's Palace.\n\nThe ambiance is entertaining and you get sucked in if you are a fan of the show.  Even before you walk in, the big HK & pitchfork great you outside!  The minute you step in the door, a fulll size video screen of Chef Ramsay himself motion sensors turns on, and starts encouraging you to hurry up in and get inside.   Decent little gift shop - all wit HK merchandise.  \n\nWe had reservations, and the place was buzzing.  We were there for lunch on Saturday.  We were seated pretty quickly, (considering the amount of people we saw in the shop\/waiting area).  The kitchen is exactly what you see on TV.  Kudos, cause the excitement sparks you up the minute you see the red\/blue open faced kitchen.  We were seated WAY in the back - meaning opposite of the kitchen (if the kitchen is the front) in like a back room\/open, which was a great view if you want LV, but not if you wanted the kitchen view.  (no negative for that - just a statement).\n\nService was great - very attentive, and they were very gracious explaining the concept, the menu, as though you had no clue who Gordon Ramsey was, or the show was, including explaining that they can't mess up the risotto or the scallops.   Drinks were AMAZING.  My husband had some smoked whisky concoction, that is presented at the table in a 'vault' and opened and all the smoke clears, he loved it.  I had some gin concoction that was AMAZING, however it was fruit heavy at the top, and the recent straw ban made it very awkward to drink.   I did ask for a straw, and our waiter also agreed, that'd he'd serve this with a straw, but are not allowed to) brought over a red and blue paper straw for me to choose.   So good for them being environmentally friendly, but that drink needs a straw FYI!  \n\nWe had to have the scallops and risotto.  I honestly felt that the scallops had sat at the pass a little longer than the risotto, as they weren't the same temperature.  They were prepared well, but the temp was my only criticism.  Risotto had great flavor, lobster was perfect.   My lunch entree was short rib grilled cheese, my husband had the Ramsay burger.   I felt the grilled cheese was a little greasy,, but what do you expect with short ribs, butter\/grilled cheese.  Short ribs had a great flavor.  Could have used more cheese.  My husband loved his hamburger.    We shared a sticky toffee pudding for dessert and that was AMAZING.   So light and flavorful.  \n\nChef Michelle was walking around, and stops at tables, and has a very respectable conversation with each and every guest, taking pictures if requested.  For such a young person, who fame was thrust upon her, she is handling it with such grace!   We loved talking to her, and she never rushed us, or made us feel like 'hurry up, I got a kitchen to run\".","date":"2018-08-26 16:27:10"}

So I opted for the 3 course lunch for $60. \n\nFirst course: Pumpkin soup. Considering I'm not a huge pumpkin fan, this wasn't bad! The bowl just has the chorizo and pumpkin seeds in it, and they poured the soup over it at the table. The chorizo gave it a nice kick. I personally didn't like having the seeds in the soup. The bowl was also flat so it cooled pretty quickly, and I prefer my soups hot. \n\nMain course: Beef Wellington. So when it came out, I thought it looked small. But I ended up getting full still. It was delicious! The sauce complimented it well, and I also enjoyed the potato puree. It wasn't the most light and airy I've ever had, but still pretty good. \n\nDessert: Sticky toffee pudding.

I had high expectations for this restaurant. Super fail. Glad we came with a food comp! Haha. Both had a prefix menu. And an app. Lets start the review\n\nLoberster risotto: 4\/10.  Lobster was over cooked.  Risotto wasnt super great. My friends comment that trader Joe's lobster risotto was better is true.. I agree that a bagged risotto is better. Wow. How can be saying that. But true\n\nSeared scallops.  6\/10 Came out over done. Pretty good flavor composition with them\n\nBeef Wellington 6.5\/10 . (The most famous dish)  dish was cooked just fine. Just super bland. Regular unflavored mashed potatoes and few steamed carrot. Really? Didnt get much blander. Keep in mind this dish is 49$ regularly.  \n\nCoffee ice cream brownie dessert. 7.5\/10. This actually was pretty good. \n\nService was really good. \n\nOverall I would never come back and actually pay for a meal here. Super sad we wasted our 180 comp on this place.","date":"2018-06-29 22:00:25"}

We have all watched the show and was super excited to try the famous scallops, lobster risotto, and beef wellington.  We also had the opportunity to try the pumpkin soup, caesar salad, Hell's Kitchen burger, and the sticky toffee pudding.\n\nThe scallops were not memorable but compared to everything else, it was definitely not the worst.\n\nThe lobster risotto came out raw and it felt like we were eating a mouthful of sand.  Luckily our server, Nick, was able to grab us a new plate which was MUCH better but still a tad bit under cooked.\n\nThe beef wellingtons came out pink but cold.  Kind of disappointed considering we had high hopes, especially for what we presume to be the star dish.\n\nThe pumpkin soup and caesar salad was pretty good.  The burger was spicy and probably the best main dish we had.\n\nThe star of our meal was definitely the sticky toffee pudding.\n\nFor over $250, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone; there are many other options at this price for far superior food.","date":"2018-02-13 05:26:45"}

We arrived in Las Vegas could not miss it... Gordon Ramsay opened 7 weeks ago & we had to go. The master of culinary experience, some still call him the king of food, food was fair. $120 (without wine or dessert) for 2 for lunch - did not impress us. We had reservations but waited 20 minutes to be seated at the worse table of the restaurant (bad luck), table was next to order station & hostess choose to seat my wife facing the waiters & valet of waiters coming in and out of the kitchen - instead of the view of window which was nice. I recuested another table & hostess response was those are for VIP's - she hesitated after I insisted& when I asked \"how do I become a VIP \" she had no clue. I didn't know there were 2 sets of clients when you reserve? She finally went to ask & returned by seating us at another table. She didn't tell the waiter we were there & when we complained about a smelly glass, the waiter said he was not inhormed we were there. He changed the glass- threw away the full glass of sparkling water we paid for & when my wife called him on it, he said I will get you another bottle. The food was good but not like \"wow\" with a limited menu. Then we ordered espresso that was really horrible - tasted like dirt- and they forgot the spoon and the sugar -- after all what Gordon promotes on his show about quality of service and perfection - a real disappointing experience. & I would not recommend Hells Kitchen in Las Vegas !","date":"2018-03-20 01:42:03"}

The reservation was for 9:45. I showed up at 9:30 and was very pleased to be seated a full 10 minutes early. Thank goodness too because the bar where I had planned on waiting until my table was ready was totally packed.\n My server, F-ing John F (insert Ramsay inflection here), was amazing! Every need was attended to before I knew that I needed anything, he was warm and personable, prompt and swift. If you want ridiculously good service, do yourself a favor and just ask to be served by F-ing John F. Attention to detail allows Hell's Kitchen to run like a smoothly choreographed performance that looks nearly effortless. Judging on the quality of the food, it is anything but effortless.\n I chose the prefixe menu with the scallops, Wellington and sticky toffee pudding. In addition I was served an amuse bouche of goat cheese and watermelon with black pepper that was both surprising as well as delicious. The Wellington was cook to perfect mid-rare. The pastry was neither dry nor greasy, it was also perfect. The potato puree the Wellie rested upon was probably made by angels because it was simply divine. By the time the dessert had arrived, all hot and gooey with it's perfect cannelle of fresh ice cream like a fat little crown on top, gluttony grabbed me by the taste buds once again. Over and over from course 1 right on through course 4. Unfreakinbelievable. \n F-ing John F talked me into three shots of the most amazing espresso in Vegas ( I have almost come down from the caffeine buzz 2 weeks later! )\n If you are in Vegas and don't eat at Hell's Kitchen, you don't know what you are missing. 10 thumbs up \nBravo Chef Ramsay, I will be back for that tomahawk steak!","date":"2018-06-23 04:16:33"}

The spots fill up really quickly! Being such a hot new restaurant, everybody wants to try.\n\nWe got there in time for our reservation at 6:45pm.  Checked in with the hostess, and stood to the side while we waited for our names to be called.  There were a lot of people standing and waiting to be called.\nWe ended up getting seated around 7:00pm, there were a lot of empty tables when we were finally seated.\n\nThe service was very good and quick.  Waters were topped up often, dishes were recommended.\n\nGot a complementary palate cleanser to start.  It was watermelon cube with some pepper, it was very a nice small refreshing bite.\n\nOur party of 4 ordered a variety.  One ordered the 3 course meal (scallops, beef wellington, sticky toffee pudding), another ordered crispy skin salmon, a rack of lamb and lastly another order of beef wellington.\n\nThe scallops were nicely cooked, but were cut very thinly.  So what looked like 5 pieces were perhaps only 2.5 scallops.\n\nThe main course came very quickly, and it was nice to watch all the chefs doing their own thing to get the plates out in a timely fashion.\n\nThe beef wellington looked perfect.  Crispy top, perfect medium rare.  But having 2 pieces is very filling.  It might not look like a lot, but once you eat it, it starts to accumulate on you.\nThe crispy skin salmon was good.  Nice crispy skin, and salmon that was slightly over cooked.  Wanted something more moist on the inside.\n\nThe rack of lamb was beautiful.  Medium rare, thick slices, and very meaty.\nThis came with greens (not sure if it was spinach), but it was EXTREMELY salty.  To the point it was bitter, like they accidentally salted this twice.  We explained this to the busboy that came to pick up my plate at the end of dinner.  He turned around and explained it to our waitress.  \nBut....the waitress didn't do anything or acknowledge.  I didn't want to say anything (usually i say everything is fine when they ask), but thought I'd proactively give feedback so they could better their business.  But nope...nothing.  Then she just handed us the bill.\n\nI had to flag her down and ask her if we still had a dessert for the 3 course menu.  And she looked at the bill, then apologized and took the bill back.\n\nThe dessert was really good!  Just like the one at Gordon Ramsay's Steakhouse!  The ice cream melted on the toffee cake, it was nicely paired with sauce.  not too sweet and overpowering.\n\nGreat dessert!\n\nThe restaurant was nice, way too loud, perhaps with how it's set up (one big open box) and all the talking echoing, we had to literally shout to each other.  \nThe service was quick.\n\nBut really, i think this place is over hyped.  It's been open a few months already, but i think they're still overwhelmed by the number of customers.","date":"2018-05-11 16:27:22"}

We had Sunday night reservations here and promptly seated about 10-15 minutes after we got there -- they had originally seated us in the back area but we requested to be seated in the front area near the kitchen so they accommodated us. Our server was extremely helpful and provided stellar service; I don't remember his name but he was the best. We ordered the pre-fixe menu which included the scallops appetizer, the beef Wellington, and a sticky toffee pudding. We also added on an additional order of the lobster risotto. I was tempted to order the crispy skin salmon as well but luckily I didn't because we were pretty full after all the food we got, but I'm definitely going to be trying that next time. All the food was delicious; the scallops were perfectly seared, the risotto was slightly different from the usual, it was a saffron tomato risotto which is a recipe created by chef Michelle, the winner on HK season 17 who also happened to be working there that night. We also ordered 2 cocktails -- one of them came in a box with steam coming out of it and the other one contained a note from gordon Ramsay (one of his quotes lol). I don't usually like desserts as much but the sticky toffee pudding was probably my favorite dish; it was extremely delicious. At the end, we were even able to take a picture with Michelle! Definitely recommended -- the food was really good, the service was excellent, and overall it was a pretty good & memorable experience.","date":"2018-06-01 04:09:00"}

The hostess staff, all dressed in red dresses, were very welcoming and we were seated quickly prior to our reservation time. We decided to try the scallops, which are a staple of the show, and the meatballs as appetizers. Both were excellent choices!!!\n\nInstead of the preset menu, we decided to go with burgers. I had the HK Burger which was cooked precisely to order. It's hot and spicy and the ghost pepper cheese was a new experience for me. We also tried a Short Rib Grill Cheese which we are determined to learn to make when we get back to Iowa. \n\nThe service was excellent from start to finish, the atmosphere was great, and the meal was one of the best we've had on this weekend visit.

At $24 the lobster risotto appetizer was the worst thing ordered all night. The risotto was bland with bad texture and the small diced butternut squash mixed in was undercooked. The lobster was also underseasoned and overcooked and chewy.\n\nThe short rib and jus were very tasty and cooked well but I was not impressed with the sides of the dish. The polenta was nice and creamy with good texture but was also underseasoned. The vegetables were terrible that came with it. Basically steamed vegetables - 1.5 brussel sprouts with a few carrot balls and pearl onions. The was the only dish that I really thought justified the price tag ($34).\n\nThe salmon itself was good but the sides were also nothing to write home about. The mac and cheese sides was very creamy and cheesy and worth ordering. The brussel sprouts were also very good (but spicy).\n\nThe sticky toffee pudding was definitely the highlight of the meal and had a large portion that we could all share. Chocolate mousse cake tasted like something you could buy at the grocery store. \n\nThe service was wonderful though, perhaps even a little too attentive (ex. asked multiple times to clear our plates when we still weren't finished).

I had high expectations.\n\nBut the food and the service were both somewhat bizarre and I'd emphatically state that there was more flash than substance to the new restaurant.\n\nIt took 15 minutes to get our waiter to acknowledge us and another 15 to get a glass of water. Odd beginning. When asked about food allergies, our friend stated that he was allergic to garlic. The waiter (Michael) promptly stated that there would be little or nothing our dining companion could eat in the restaurant. An argument ensued about the quality of the chef who could not prepare a dish without garlic. So in this lovely setting, our guest ate quinoa salad. That was all the kitchen could accommodate.\n\nThe scallops were great. My smoked beet salad was good. My husband's chicken was very over cooked and as Ramsay would say, \"My nana could do better and she's f***ing dead!\". Caesar salad was underwhelming. When all was said and done, we skipped dessert and called it a night.\n\nI wanted this to be a great experience for many reasons. To say the least, we were underwhelmed.

The servers looked like they hated their lives. None smiled, and just overall looked miserable to be there. Our server was attentive enough, but seemed annoyed to work in this restaurant. \n\n2. The food was really average. No one at the table really was wowed by their choice in dish. I ordered the chicken sandwich for example, and it was just okay. Our table also ordered the wings, and the burger, and again, just average.\n\n3. Apparently you can't make substitutions? I really don't like french fries so I asked if I could get some steamed vegetables instead (or any other side!). The server said there is no way to make steamed vegetables in the kitchen.....so you're telling me this 5 star restaurant is completely lacking in all vegetables? It's one thing if there is an upcharge for it ( I would've paid for it gladly!), but to not offer any other side than fries just seems odd to me. \n\n4. The server was really annoyed when my sister asked if there was any vegan options. He quickly said there wasn't, and that he had no recommendations for her. \n\n\nThe good.\n\n1.

A total contrast to the way too sweet cocktails typically served in Vegas.\n\n\nI think I would give this restaurant another chance for dinner, but I can say I will never ever come back again for lunch.","date":"2018-08-26 21:44:37"}

It's refreshing and by far one of the best drinks ever!! Not only was I surprised by the drink, it comes with a 'note' from Gordon on the garnish with one of his sayings from the show. Hilarious! Especially when you have someone read it out to you with a British accent like my husband tried to do. At the end of our meal, we got their coffee, which is by Intelligencia (a third wave coffee- a new term I just learned but this brand has been doing it for decades. Look it up.) A perfect end to a perfect meal.\n\nHint: come hungry and get the pre fixe with the Wellington. Looks like the best deal, and you get the best of the restaurant. I'll need to come back to get that next time.\n\nOverall this is a must try!","date":"2018-01-14 09:40:25"}

The flavors were so good and everything complimented each other.  He first course was an asparagus soup which was super rich and creamy.  Obviously the main course was great like I just mentioned and the beef was a perfect medium rare.  The last course was a dessert which I can't remember he name but it was like a toffee flavor cake that was super moist and had ice cream on top.  If I remember the name of it I will repost.  But it was so good that my wife even liked it which was surprising because she does not like that kind if sweetness.\n\nWe were also able to get a picture with the latest winner of the show, so I can actually say I met a celebrity.

We were finally able to try some of Gordon Ramsay's most popular dishes, including the beef wellington and his sticky toffee pudding. The beef wellington was delicious -- but only available as part of the three-course meal set during lunch hours. Additionally, we ordered the wagyu meatballs, the salmon, grilled steak sandwich, and the HK Burger. Everything tasted amazing, but the beef wellington received some mixed reviews from my own party. It can be polarizing if you're not a huge fan of mushrooms, but as a mushroom lover myself I enjoyed it. \n\nNow time for the finale: the sticky toffee pudding was OUT OF THIS WORLD.

While we were in Las Vegas we ate at the Aria buffet, Bellagio buffet and Hell's Kitchen. I would rate the order 1. Aria 2. Bellagio and 3. Hell's Kitchen.\nWith that being said I'm not saying I didn't like Hells Kitchen. We had a great table right where we could watch all the food prep going on. I would recommend one of these tables over the strip view if you go but that's just my opinion. So we had reviewed the menu choices before we went and I had the Prix Fix menu which included scallops as the appetizer, followed by the famous Beef Wellington and than a Toffee Pudding. My wife had the Lobster Risotto appetizer and Crispy Salmon main course.\nThe appetizers were just ok. The scallops had to much of a bacon taste which took away from the butteriness. The risotto was good but kind of a strange texture to the risotto and fairly bland. I was expecting to be blown away but started off just average. Next was the Beef Wellington. The meat was tender but not as tasty as I was hoping. Again it was good but not great. My wife's Salmon was very good and the Mashed Potatoes were decent. Finally the desert which was a home run. It tastes way better than it looks in pictures although it would have been even better with 2 scoops of ice cream.\nOur waiter was French and was ok but not great just like the food. He was semi involved with our table while being very involved with the 2 tables surrounding us. He seemed to want us to get 2 deserts but when we only wanted one he kind of marched away from the table. He just gave me a strange feeling like we were irritating him and he seemed irritated when we asked him if he could take a picture of us at the end of our meal and did not make eye contact with me after that.\nWe are not drinkers so our bill came to $165 and we tipped $25 so $190. I would have been ok spending even more than this if everything was better than good but unfortunately it wasn't. So not bad but not great. So many great dining options in this city we will most likely not be back.","date":"2018-02-28 05:57:55"}

Do not kid yourself, the purpose of this one is to make money........I know all of them have this purpose but this one it screams at you even before you walk in. ** Met Michelle Tribble the HK season 17 winner. Took a picture with her and she signed a Ramsay HK cookbook for us. She was very nice \/ professional. She is a teeny tiny person which from seeing her on the show surprised me. I didn't think she was 6'5\" and 250 but she is really tiny.\nSo we are big fans of all of Ramsay's TV shows and his personality knowing it is all an act for sensationalizing and promoting ratings. We know. We have eaten at all 5 of his Vegas restaurants multiple times. So, we go to HK. 8:45 pm and it is packed as expected. We get seated and order our beverages and food. Lobster Risotto and Scallops for appetizers. Both good. Scallops were small I think they cut them in half and they are not  the big jumbo sea scallops but smaller. Dinner entrees were Beef Wellington and Short Ribs. Both were excellent. Side Mac and cheese was so so and Brussels sprouts were good. 4 1\/2 stars not 5 because of  we did not order alcohol but it was heavily pushed on us multiple times. (money?). Bill was 240.00 with tip....very reasonable by Vegas standards. THE BIG DEDUCTION for me is the same as Gordon Ramsay Steak. TURN DOWN THE DAMN MUSIC. IT IS OBNOXIOUSLY LOUD AND VERY ANNOYING. IT IS WAY OVER THE THRESHOLD OF ACCEPTABLE. There must be some market research that has been done about this showing loud music and peoples dining habits with it.

From the food to the decor and not to go forget, the service! I was definitely impressed from the moment I entered the place. \n\nWe had been looking forward to coming here for a couple of months after my son picked this place to celebrate his 10th grade promotion. We have previously eaten at Gordon Ramsay Burger place, but we were disappointed and had tried to convince my son to go elsewhere, he wouldn't budge. We arrived 5 min before our reservation ( highly recommended, since it's on the strip) and checked it. The host checked us in and asked the we wait to get our table ready. We maybe waited, if that, 3 min before we were walked over to our table.\n\nThe Food: SO GOOD SO GOOD SO GOOD! We ordered the wagyu meatballs as a starter. They were amazing! There are 5 meatballs served per dish. My husband and I ordered the Tomahawk steak for 2. The menu on Cesar's Palace website shows this entree being served with 2 side dishes, however, this is not the case. According to the server, they stopped including the side dishes 2 weeks ago. Each side is $9. We ended up choosing the baked Mac n Cheese and the Potato Purée. My son chose the Crispy Skin Salmon with an added side of Potato Gratin. The food is served in a satisfying portion, enough to leave room for dessert. You can't skip dessert here....at all! There are no other words to describe the Pineapple Carpaccio than phenomenal. It's thinly sliced pineapple with coconut sorbet drizzled with passion fruit sauce. \n\nService lived up to the expectations. Tony and Jason were constantly checking in on us and giving us the status of our food. We ordered our steak medium well and he told us from the beginning that it was going to take a little longer than normal. I appreciate knowing that way I'm not just sitting there wondering what's going on. \n\nThe place itself is nice. They have the pitchfork decor and the cooks are divided into the red and blue teams. There are TV's around the restaurant that show clips from the show and they even sell Hell's Kitchen merchandise. \n\nWe had a fantastic time and we would come back again.

My mom thought it was a dessert at first sight. \nI'm not a huge fan of chicken, but this dish may have just changed my mind! The sauce, potatoes and mushrooms, oh my! They were tasty accompaniments to the perfectly broiled chicken. The chicken was not dry in the least, it was juicy and flavorful! \nThe Roasted Cauliflower with lime zest was good, but not my favorite. It was a little to raw for my taste, but it was still good.\nWe intended to come back for the Sticky Toffee Pudding, but just didn't make it on this trip - one more reason to come back!!\nWe accompanied our meal with a glass of Clean Slate Riesling and Achaval Malbec, both good and decent pours.\n\nFinally, let me make a few things clear, and maybe this will help you decipher other reviews as well.\n1. You need a reservation! But even still you may wait a few moments after arriving, reservations and dining are not an exact science.\n2. Everyone has a bad day, give the hostess and waitstaff a break. Could you keep a smile and joyful attitude all day while serving high expectation, (maybe) entitled & in a rush diners?","date":"2018-05-21 15:33:31"}

They do dress in the red\/blue jackets and the TVs do show quite a bit of the series. The location is not inside Caesar, but on South Las Vegas Blvd to the left of the main Caesar Palace Entrance.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a good size, and as soon as you walk in, you'll see the restaurant's identity. Hostess in red dress will check you in and lead you to your table.  The menu option is not the typical full menu but a scale down. Still you have quite a few choices. Ironically, their Beef Wellington is not on there as an entree, but part of their pre fixie menu. \n\nThe appetizer, Lobster Risotto was very good. The butter poached lobster was done just right, not too rubbery and the butternut squash bits put a nice crunch in the Risotto. It wasn't greasy or heavy and the portion size was perfect as an appetizer. The Pre Fixie menu came with either Caesar Salad or Pumpkin Soup. I opted for the Pumpkin Soup and it was very savory and delicious. The Beef Wellington was truly all that; done to perfection. Savory on the inside with a light and crispy pastry. The demi-glaze sauce wasn't needed but does give another taste element to the dish. The carrots and spring onions and mash potato made a good balance to the dish. The dessert, Gordon Ramsay Signature dessert, was something I didn't care much for. It was overly sweet and bigger than the main dish. The ice cream was also very heavy as I would have prefer something lighter like sherbet ice cream but with the Pre Fixie menu there's no option.","date":"2018-05-03 00:49:30"}

When we found out that Hell's Kitchen was opening in Vegas, we thought \"We NEED to go!\" Our party arrived about 20 minutes early & the friendly hostess was still able to seat us immediately. The amuse bouche, a perfect watermelon bite to cleanse our palates, started the meal off right. Our orders & reviews: 1) lobster risotto: delicious; portion was a little small (but only because we all wanted to try some); braised short ribs: a perfectly portioned, mouthwatering dish; peanut butter fudge cheesecake: although this dessert appeared a little small we realized it was small because it packed such a punch and didn't need to be big 2) caesars salad: a perfectly prepared classic; filet mignon: prepared to a perfect medium, as requested, and delicious 3) shrimp cocktail: delicious; New York strip: one of the best I've ever eaten 4) prix fixe menu (2 of us ordered): scallops: size was small but taste was HUGE; beef wellington: now we know why the scallop portion was small--the beef wellington was easily one of the best dishes either of us have ever eaten. This was the same sentiment shared by everyone at the table! And then there was the sticky toffee pudding. I don't think I can come up with appropriate words to describe this decadence! We also ordered snap peas and the mac and cheese for the table. The mac and cheese was easily the best mac and cheese I've eaten in a long time. One of the people in our party was celebrating a 21st birthday (1 of the 2 who ordered the prix fixe meal). Kerry M., our server, brought over chocolate mousse cake (at no charge). This was in addition to the sticky toffee pudding that came with the meal. The birthday boy said it was the best dessert he has ever had...by far!!!!

I called the day they opened and reserved a table for Friday March 23rd for our anniversary dinner. It was our 'main event' for going to vegas.\n\nWhen we arrived we were so excited to see the beauty of the layout and we peeked around the corner and got giddy when we saw Michelle working.\n\nWe were less than excited that despite our early booking, we were put at a table in the back of the house, where we couldn't see the kitchen.\n\nThe napkins are beautiful (we stole one) and decor is top notch, suited for high end crowds. The crowds, however, are typically noisy and underdressed. \n\nThe female wait staff wears beautiful elegant red dresses, and are friendly. Our waiter, nick, was great at first.\n\nLobster risotto and scallop appetizers started us off strong. Loved them. Great flavor and texture. Wish we could've had more. My cocktail was too strong but its vegas.\n\nI ordered the Wellington and my wife ordered the NY Strip. This is where it went sour. Her ny strip was good, but not great. Like what I cook at home. You can taste the grill, like it wasn't cleaned well.\n\nThe beef Wellington looks amazing but is lacking major key ingredients. I'm sure to the less knowledgeable it's passable but: there was no mustard on the filet, there was BARELY any ham\/prosciutto, and the amount of mushroom duxelle was pathetic. When I took my first bite I could tell there was no flavor, and when I opened it up it made me so disappointed. \n\nWhen I asked the waiter, nick, of this he waived it off as normal and that's how they're made. No... I've made ramsay's Wellington recipe. It's not this.\n\nIt seems like the food they cook is more for presentation and profit, but they rely on their guests to be ignorant of actual flavor. If chef Ramsay reads this, take that recipe and SHUT IT DOWN.\n\nWe ordered brussel sprouts with it. They were good but overcooked. We ate 1\/3 and quit.\n\nNow, back to nick... after I voiced my concern, he virtually disappeared. Our wait times between menus were epic. We even had to flag a busser for more water.\n\nI typically tip over 20% but this time I struggled to give 10% sorry to all the hard working staff sharing tips but nick needs retraining. \n\nAt the end we got our guts together and interrupted Michelle hard at work for a picture. She is so gracious and kind to comply.

Reservations were at 1:00, but because of no traffic we arrived nearly 30 minutes early, so we were told to wait in line.\n\nWe were seated about the time of our original reservation, not in the main room of the restaurant, but in the back, with views of Caesar's Palace and the Strip, not the kitchen, so my mother-in-law was disappointed.\n\nI began my meal with the Smoked Golden Beets Salad, and it was superb. It seemed to be the perfect temperature, cool, but not cold. The beets were flavorful and cooked to perfection, and the pistachio granola provided a welcome crunch. Everything tasted FRESH.\n\nFor my main I think l made a mistake by trying the Margherita Pizza, so as to compare it with my favorite pizza restaurant. While everything was again fresh, and looked beautiful, the crust was not very flavorful, and the tomatoes were mostly tasteless as well. It is February, and I guess decent tomatoes are hard to come by. \n\nI tried the Hells Kitchen IPA by Stone Brewing to go along with my pizza and enjoyed it.\n\nDessert was divine. I think it was called Pineapple Carpaccio. The dry ice provided quite the show, but the thin ribbons of cool sliced pineapple and coconut sorbet were the star, and not too sweet. \n\nI tasted the Pan Seared Scallops and Lobster Risotto my dining companions ordered and both were delicious. I would like to add that I think the lunch menu is different from the dinner menu.\n\nWhen we left the restaurant at 2:00 on a weekday afternoon there was no line to get in.\n\n As my mother-in-law uses a walker we parked at Caesars valet. From there it was a short walk to the restaurant. Otherwise parking in the hotel garage is more of a schlep.\n\nI would expect nothing but the best food from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and except for the pizza I tried, that is what I got.\n\nOne last word: the music is a tad loud and makes it difficult to hear your server or engage in conversation with your fellow diners. But that is typical of restaurants these days.","date":"2018-02-15 05:46:35"}

She said to wait in line and that they were about to start seating the 4:15 group. It took about 30 minutes for us to be seated. When we sat down, it took a little bit for our server to say hello, but they were busy so we understood. Our server was extremely pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu. He got our drinks and we ordered our meals (I did the pre fixed menu and my boyfriend ordered just the Mac and cheese). My appetizer came out very quickly and my scallops were cooked perfectly and were delicious. So far, so good. After my appetizer to took another HOUR for our entrees to come out. Our server was apologetic, but still it was pretty bad. There wasn't any kind of bread of anything either, so we were both getting pretty hangry. Once our entrees came out, they were both so good. The Wellington was perfectly cooked and his Mac and cheese was filling on its own. We waited about another 20 minutes after we finished for our dessert (sticky toffee pudding was also really good) and another 10 minutes after that to get our check. In total, we were there for around 2 1\/2 hours. We had plans with friends we had to cancel because we weren't going to make it in time, so that sucked.

The design and concept is pretty cool. The downside outweighs the cool design. We literally were there for 3 hours for lunch. Not 3 hours waiting in line, cuz we had a reservation. The service was lackluster. The only positive of service was the busser. He kept our water glasses full. The waiter we had was kind of cocky and lost some serious interest in his job. My in laws ordered wine and he was gone real quick and yet my wife didn't get to place her drink order. When we wanted water, that took awhile to get. As soon as the water comes, we were ready to order and the waiter took off. After 15 min, we place our order. Where is our waiter?? Needed to ask some questions. After 45 min we finally get our appetizers. All but one. My in laws got their pumpkin soup, lobster risotto and I got my wagyu meatballs yet my wife didn't get her pumpkin soup. As we get another server to bring her soup, the only thing that was hot was the meatballs. The soup was luke warm and half the risotto is cold. How can a high price place put out cold food. My wife soup finally arrives and it's barely warm. After another 30-45 min waiting for our entrees, more bad food. The beef Wellington was over cooked and not very warm. My wife got her steak and thankfully it was hot and good. My chicken sand was pathetic. For almost $20, it was a mess. 2 thin slices of chicken breast that was dry, covered with big tomatoe ball covering the gaps on the bread where chicken should be, an Avacado spread that had NO seasoning and so much on the bread that it was soggy. Also, the meat was COLD!!! The French Fries it came with were crispy but again, no salt. Just bland French fries. No salt or pepper on the table and asking the crappy server would take who knows how much longer. I ate the 2 thin slices of chicken breast and some fries. Left the slop of everything else just because it wasn't edible. As a local, this was very disappointing. Waste of money and will prolly never go back to that trap. If Gordon Ramsay was there, I would of told him how can he put his name on such shit food. Then it also took another 20 min for us to pay pur check. This place sucks and I hope the issues get fixed.

Hardly enough for the both of us to share (so we got another app).  Didn't have much flavor and I honestly think rice a roni is better.  To have so much hype and it not even be 'good' was very disappointing, even for my husband.  Said the pre-made risotto cake we get from fresh market is better.  \nScallops- delicious yet tiny.  Looks like they were cut in half.  5 of then for $22, and they were probably 1-1.5 inches in diameter.  Great presentation with pea purée but again, so not worth the money.\nHusband had the filet- very tender, but not much else going for it.  Bland, a little dry.  About $50 and didn't even come with a side.  \nI had a burger, though a lot of sandwiches sounded good so it was hard to choose.  Probably the best value for the money on the menu, but again had little flavor.  Even the fries were just okay, although they were crispy which I like.  \nTotal bill for 2 people with a beer and 2 teas was over $120 without tip.  \nService was excellent, very nice and professional, constantly coming to fill drinks and remove empty dishes.

This is truly HELL lol.\n\nWe were seated promptly (there was no wait) and we had no reservations. Our server asked us what kind of water we wanted and we said \"still\" because that's what we say at all the other restaurants (because we didn't want the bubbly sparkling water). FATAL MISTAKE!!! Should've said FREE water... I'll get back to this later....\n\nLobster risotto: 5\/5 \nI would come back for this again, it was really good! Rich and creamy, the lobster had a nice bite and wasn't too chewy. I should've just ordered this only. \n\nBraised short rib: 3\/5\nSALTY!! I enjoyed how tender it was, but it made me extremely thirsty and I would have to take a sip of water after pretty much every bite. I still liked it but it was average and not worth the price. I was flying through the glasses of water.\n\nMy friends ordered the beef Wellington and both of them agreed it was dry and disappointing. It was probably the worst thing we tried. \n\nIn comparison, we all enjoyed Gordon Ramsay's Burger (BURGR) way more. Everything there was delicious and didn't taste a dry salt bomb! \n\nSo as I said, we were drinking tons of water because everything was so salty. It felt really strange because our server kept asking us if we wanted another bottle of water (and other restaurants we've dined at never felt so hesitant on bringing us water refills) but we didn't think much of it... UNTIL THE BILL CAME. \n\nWe were shocked that we were charged $8 each for water. It left an extremely bad taste to our mouths (but maybe even that is more appetizing than the salty food lol). My friend took the real L though, she ordered a $15 drink as well so she essentially paid $20+ for two drinks yikes. \n\nIt wasn't until this happened that we noticed other tables didn't have the water bottle... we were so confused! Where did everything go wrong??? Our server never specified what the choices for water was and if we would have known we would be stuck with a $30 charge for WATER we would've asked for clarification. It felt super shady. If the server asks you what kind of water you want, don't say still because apparently that translates to fancy water??  L\n\nI would recommend you to skip this place and head over to Ramsay's other restaurant unless you want to feel like an IDIOT SANDWICH for paying an exorbitant price for water.","date":"2018-08-19 21:10:27"}

We are big fans of all the GR's restaurants in Vegas.\nThe restaurant was very busy, even at our 9:45 pm reservation time. We were seated at a very  nice table away from the main dining area which is where the open kitchen is located.  Our waiter, Christopher, was with us within a few minutes, after his assistant greeted us and brought waters. My husband and I both ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. Total price was $120.00 pp not including tax or gratuity.\nThe food was wonderful, as expected. The appetizers were a choice of Caesar salad (delicious crunchy Parmesan crisps) or scallops (perfectly cooked).  The entree was Beef Wellington, which can only be ordered medium rare (warning to those who like their beef cooked more) that melted in your mouth. The dessert was the famous and decadent sticky toffee pudding\/cake with a scoop of ice cream. \nAs wonderful as the meal was, we honestly enjoyed the tasting menu w\/ wine pairings more at GR Steak at Paris. The reason:  I think a tasting menu needs to have more than 3 courses. The one we had at Paris several years ago had four course plus an amuse bouche. The price was quite a bit higher, $210 pp at the time, without tax or gratuity, but I think people who want a true tasting menu wouldn't balk at spending the extra money. If pricing is a concern, why not cut the portions of the appetizers and offer both?  My Caesar salad could have been half the size as could the number of scallops. And as much as I love the sticky toffee pudding, it was too big and I could only each half of it. After all, this is a TASTING menu and no one expects full portions.\nOn a final note, the wine parings were lovely and complemented each course. Christopher was a personable and knowledgeable waiter and we kept him busy with questions throughout dinner.\nIt was a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  Thanks to All.","date":"2018-04-30 21:47:30"}

Upon arriving a little bit early, we decided to head in and check in with the host (we got there at 10:17pm) and I told the hostess my name and the party number, but I also told her it's okay if the table isn't ready; we can wait until our RVSP time. She was totally okay with it and said that they would call us when it's ready. Within a couple of minutes, the table was ready and we were good to go. (Great customer services by the way) \n\n\nTrina, Michelle and I, didn't want to order three of the fix menu since that would be too much food for us so we order one appetizer (Lobster Risotto $24), one fix menu which was seared scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding and we order another dessert peanut butter cheesecake.

It is located right on Las Vegas Blvd with views of the strip.  Entering front of house l, Gordon is up on a huge plasma and says hello when you walk by.  The bar is beautifully appointed with all of the best liquors which is expected.  Pitchfork chandeliers through out the restaurant and of course the famous red and blue kitchen.   The night started off with some cocktails (notes from Gordon and a whiskey drink that comes smoked to the table). For dinner lobster risotto and a filet with the delicious cauliflower and Mac n cheese.  This is a must eat while your in Las Vegas.  The price is median ranging from $25 to $100 a person.

One side seared and the other side still supple and melt in your mouth.

The lobster is sliced and just falls off tenderly. The first bite is buttery like fresh sourdough, then it gets creamy and sweet. Love the crispy sage and the chew to the rice. Nice layers of flavour notes!\n\nThe beef wellington has a sweet pastry very similar to the triangular chinese bbq pork puff pastry. The beef in the middle is more like a brisket than a steak.\n\nThe sticky toffee pudding is the best part and made me forget about everything else. It's to die for! The idea of sticky toffee doesn't appeal to me at first and I thought it would be sticky and too sweet, but it's not at all! It's a fluffy chocolate cake with toffee sauce seeped in at the sides and topped with cold Speculoos (a shortcrust cookie) ice cream.

Because I can tell you that without a doubt they are completely full of crap!!!  Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen is not just good, it is a really great restaurant!  I really wanted them to screw something up, just so I could call it bland and send it back!  But I couldn't, it was all great!  That doesn't mean it was perfect, and I could see how some people may feel let down because there is still a lot of hype surrounding the opening of Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas.  But if you look at it for what it is, and what it is meant to be, it does a great job!  I personally think Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris is a nicer and better restaurant.  But I need to explain why.  Gordon Ramsay Steak is a fine dining restaurant, dinner moves at a very slow pace and there are many more options to pick from at Gordon Ramsay Steak!  Hell's Kitchen is designed to be a very high volume restaurant.  It is designed to give the Fanny Packers and Tourists from all over the country, and all over the world, myself included the opportunity to try some of Gordon's dishes and experience one of his restaurants.  The menu is very limited, just like on the TV show.  But each dish is executed perfectly and everything tasted amazing!  The Lobster Risotto was the best I have ever had!!!  I loved the Scallops as well, they were cooked perfectly and were pretty straightforward.  The Beef Wellington was perfect and totally lived up to it's reputation!  We tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which I have had before and it is always so good!  I also tried the Pineapple Carpaccio.  It was a really fun dessert served with liquid Nitrogen.  But the Pineapple was under ripe, and so it was super tart and was a bit of let down.  I wouldn't order it again.  Our server was also not great, we were somewhat ignored most of the time and he even screwed up our bill.  I didn't bother to have him correct it because he was so busy.  So do a couple little missteps in a really crowded busy restaurant make it a bad experience or bad restaurant?  Not at all!  Overall it was a great experience!  It was so fun to meet Michelle for a moment from the last season of Hell's Kitchen.  The food was great and I am sure I will be back again soon.  But if you want a much slower paced fine dining experience try Gordon Ramsay Steak instead!  Hell's Kitchen is much more fun and fast paced, and it needs to be with the crowds standing out front!  I hope you get your chance to try the Lobster Risotto, Scallops, Beef Wellington, and some Sticky Toffee Pudding soon!!!","date":"2018-06-12 23:09:20"}

The food was delicious! My waiter Nick was excellent and very knowledgeable.  He recommended the Beet salad which was delicious.  The combination of Greek yogurt,  balsamic and use of kumquats was amazing. Probably the best beet salad I've had.  I wasn't incredible hungry so I got the seafood platter. I wanted a nice white wine to pair with it and Nick was very helpful.  He suggested the Marsanne which paired perfectly. I had a great experience here and my waiter made it amazing.

The design of the restaurant is fantastic and the way the kitchen is set up looks like the TV show with red and blue teams cooking. I was with a group in a private area and the service was unbelievable. Very attentive wait staff that was there anytime they were needed, very impressive! We had a drink that was served smoked inside of a metal carrier which I highly recommend. They even went so far as to refold your napkin if you were to get up from the table. \nTo start I had a Caesar salad which was simple and very delicious, I really can't say what it was that was on the salad but when it comes to flavor it was right on. \nHere's the sad part, I ordered the filet mignon and while it was very tender it was flavorless and disappointing. Having eaten at the Gordon Ramsey steakhouse in the Paris hotel this came as quite a surprise because the steak over there was unbelievable. Dessert was a chocolate cake and ice cream dish that was not anything to write home about but did the job. \nWould I go here again? Probably not, but it was a nice experience.

The restaurant was busy but not too noisy. One of the nice things is they didn't pack in the tables like they could have so there was good spacing between the seating. We had a nice gentleman, by the name of Alexander that took great care of us. Amongst a party of three we had the quinoa salad, lobster risotto, the Beef Wellington, potato gratin, roasted cauliflower and sticky toffee pudding desert. The Beef Wellington was pretty incredible - we were told they will only serve it medium rare - the filet was prepared perfectly - very tender with the nice flakey crust. The lobster risotto was a very nice dish - for the sides the potatoes were nothing special but the cauliflower was good. Side dishes are good for max 3 people. We were impressed with the quinoa salad and of course the sticky toffee pudding was a yummy conclusion to a nice meal. Pricing I thought wasn't bad for a restaurant 'on the Strip' the Wellington was about $49 and was shared by two people - a good sized filet - I would say maybe 8oz? Side dishes were $9 and pudding $12 - so pretty reasonable in my opinion. Chef Michelle from the tv show is there and many people were taking photos. This is one of the most popular and difficult places to get a reservation at the moment - so definitely plan in advance if you wish to dine. I would definitely recommend it.

There's no way you can miss the massive hell Kitchen sign on the strip and even if you have no idea what the show is. This place is a must visit. Rarely do restaurants create an experience that's beyond food but this place does both. \n\nYou've got big fiery sign from the actual show to welcome you and then large screen with a life size Gordon Ramsey to greet you. You will need a reservation if you want to be seated properly at a table unless you're good with bar seating which is open first come first serve. Tables here are booked days and weeks in advance so be sure to call. \n\nThe food here is everything you've seen in the show. From the beef Wellington to the lobster risotto. All the signature Gordon Ramsey dishes are served here. We ordered the risotto and scallops for our appetizers and they were impeccable. \n\nThe mains though were a little disappointing. You'd expect the chefs to pay more attention to detail and meat temperatures but sadly they don't. I ordered a fillet mignon that came out over cooked the first time and medium rare the second even though I ordered a medium. The beef Wellington was also a little over cooked. The kitchen did take my criticism and made sure that my orders were refired and I did end up enjoying my meal.\n\nTo end it all off. We had their sticky pudding and chocolate mousse desserts which were out of this world.

My husband ordered the New York steak and I ordered the pre fixe menu.  The seared scallops was pathetic.  They looked so flat and dry, as if they had been sitting underneath lamp too long.  They were salty and tasted old, not fresh or tasty at all!  When our main course arrived, my beef wellington was rare, not medium rare.  I asked the server to cook it to the right temperature and she said they don't do that.  That's how it comes.  Both of our entrees were lukewarm warm.  How is this possible if it was just made?!?  I only ate 1\/2 of the beef wellington because I was hungry.  The texture and taste of eating rare, warm bland meat was not appetizing one bit!  The meat didn't agree with me afterwards, as I was nauseous for a couple hours after leaving.  Our server didn't come back to check on us and ignored us.

Everything else was business as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing mind blowing either. I have my overall review down below if you want to skip all the details. Here we go:\n\nI ordered three appetizers: scallops, \"wagyu\" meatballs, and tuna tartare. \n\nThe tartare was as perfect of a dish as you can get: a little sweet, a little spice, a little crunch. I like the taro chips it was served with. Very clean and fresh dish. Mouth watering. \n\nI loved ALMOST everything about the scallops too. Perfect sear, super flavorful celeriac purée, and nice clean garnishes like pickled apples. My single issue with the dish is that you are served five HALVED scallops. Oy vay. Why oh why are you cutting these delicate, beautiful pillows of the sea in half? Naturally, they were a bit over cooked. But again, the flavor was on point. No doubt about that. \n\nAnd finally we have the \"wagyu\" meatballs. So here we have meatballs: a poor man's food, traditionally made with cheaper cuts of meat. In my opinion, using something as special as wagyu beef in such a dish is preposterous, over indulgent and almost sacrilegious. The exquisite flavor of such a special piece of meat is lost in all the spices and sauce and cheese that are also in there. Wagyu should take center stage of any dish where it's an ingredient. It should be cooked simply, not ground into meatballs and braised in a spicy, rich tomato sauce. That being said, the flavor was...well they were meatballs and they tasted like meatballs. Delicious, but nothing special...and nothing a beautiful Italian Nonna couldn't make better. \n\nOVERALL:\nAtmosphere - sleek, modern, trendy, beautifully designed\n\nStaff - friendly, knowledgeable and eager to please\n\nDrinks - great wine list and beautifully crafted cocktails using fresh squeezed juice to order. You can definitely notice the difference. \n\nFood - flavor and seasoning spot on. For more details, see above. \n\nFinal thoughts - for a restaurant that's been open less than a month, bravo! Plating and menu descriptions need a little work. I was definitely more impressed than I thought I would be. Kudos to the chef and BOH and FOH teams for a job well done! Congrats on a successful opening!\n\n*****UPDATE*****\n\nWent back and this time sat at a table. Britney, our server, was a delight. She had extensive knowledge of the menu and was available, but not overbearing. Louie, the GM, sat with us for us while. Down to earth and just an overall a lovely man. Manny, the AGM, took us to our table and explained the concept a little to us. He's got an upbeat attitude and you can tell he really believes in the place.  We felt very taken care of by everyone this time which made our experience that much better.","date":"2018-05-13 16:46:30"}

If you're a fan of the show, it's a must try.   I recommend the pre-fixe tasting menu.   For $69, it's well worth it.   You get a full portion of the scallops appetizer which is amazing, Beef Wellington, and the stick toffee dessert.  The complimentary appetizer leaves a lot to be desired, but free is free.   In addition, he lobster risotto is mediocre.   I was disappointed in that dish.  It was an extremely small portion and lacked the flavor one would expect.

We LOVE the show and were excited to check the restaurant out for hubby's 50th birthday.  It's in a great location, just outside Caesar's Palace.  The staff is all really nice and friendly.  But our waiter, Charles, really made this whole experience better than we could have ever imagined.  He was friendly, professional and made some awesome recommendations.  \n\nThe front of the restaurant is set up like the show set, with a red and blue side.  We had a table towards the back that had a great view of the strip. We saw last year's winner, Michelle walking around, but we didn't get a chance to talk to her.  \n\nHubby ordered the Smoke on the Blvd cocktail that was delivered in a box of cherry wood smoke.  It was quite the presentation.  I'm not a fan of rye, but this drink was really smooth.  It was garnished with a lemon peel that had the Hell's Kitchen logo burned into it.  Very cool!  I had the Notes from Gordon cocktail that was quite refreshing and easy to drink.  You get a special little note from Gordon, which is a nice touch.  LOL! \n\nHubby had the prix fixe menu with the wine pairing.  I usually don't eat seafood, but I had to try everything here.  The signature scallops were good, but I didn't care too much for scallops in general.  The pea puree and braised bacon were a nice garnish.  The beef wellington is amazing!  Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a flaky outer crust.  And to finish it all was the sticky toffee pudding.  Hubby took a bite and said, \"shut the front door\".  I don't know what it is about this dessert, but hubby has a very \"colorful\" vocabulary and I've never heard him say this phrase before.  It was rich and decadent and everything you want from Vegas.  They also gave us a complimentary pineapple carpaccio that was presented with dry ice that was amazing.\n\nMy meal consisted of the lobster risotto, filet mignon, & mac n cheese.  Like I said, I'm not a seafood person, but that lobster was delish!  The risotto  was rich and creamy and the lobster was not what I expected.  It didn't have a super fishy taste and the texture was smooth and easy to chew.  I'm sure this is what good lobster tastes like LOL!  I don't think anything will every compare to this dish.  I did give some to hubby, but I ate most of that dish by myself.  The filet was ok, I've had better, but it's not a deal breaker at all.  The mac n cheese was warm, not super hot, but tasted good.  The gouda and crispy prosciutto made the dish.  \n\nHell's Kitchen definitely lived up to our expectations and we can't wait to go back.  Cheers!","date":"2018-08-08 17:12:11"}

The food was terrible lacking any flavour and portions were small and pretentious.  My fiancee and I ate dinner here to celebrate my birthday.   I am a big fan of the show and was incredibly excited to eat here.  After reading other Yelp reviews, I had high expectations.  So I am wondering if we were unlucky and had an usual bad experience or if Yelp reviewers are overly generous in their reviews.  I'm not overly picky but after paying a bill of $250 for our meal which included only one drink amongst the two of us (a gin and tonic cocktail cost $28!!) and two appetizers and two main entrees with three sides which were an extra charge for each.  For my appetizer, I ordered the smoked beet salad; and when it arrived at our table, it salad was encompassed in a glass dome.  When our server took the lid off the dome, the smoke in the dome was released.  Great presentation, but that's about it.  The whole beet salad which was probably a few mouthfuls in total totally tasted like smoke and I couldn't taste anything else.  My fiancee ordered the red quinoa salad which I tasted and as average.  For my main entree, I ordered the filet mignon and asked for it to be medium rare.  It was inedible.  It was definitely more like well done.  I should have sent it back especially considering this cost $47.  It was so tough and flavourless and I had to gnaw each bite. The worst filet mignon that I have ever had in my life.  My fiancee also ordered the filet mignon and had the same experience as me.  He also asked for medium rare and instead received well done. How hard it is to get the meat right?  The sides were ordered were brussel sprouts, wild mushrooms and roasted cauliflower.  Each side cost $9 extra.  Nothing to rave about, but I liked the wild mushrooms the best.  Normally I would have eaten the entire portion of each side; but this time, I left some portion of each entree.  Because it was my birthday dinner, I received a complimentary sticky toffee pudding for desert.  This was probably the only decent food we ate during dinner.  \nThe service was decent.  I had made reservations on-line and when we arrived we were seated in a very timely manner.  Our server was good and very personable.  No complaints here.\nAll in all, I would never eat here again. All hype -- overpriced, small portions and quality of food was lacking in any flavour.  \nI keep on reading positive reviews for this restaurant, so I have to wonder if our experience was just bad luck or if everyone else who eats here is generous in their reviews.","date":"2018-05-01 14:15:47"}

We got there earlier than our reservation time but it wasn't an issue. They were able to get us seated next to the window overlooking the strip (best seat in the house)! The lobster risotto was recommended by our server so we decided to get that as an appetizer. We also ordered the asparagus soup and it came with a Parmesan crisp which really accentuated the flavors. I got the combo with the beef Wellington and my brother got a burger. The appetizer and the soup arrived in a timely manner but after the soup we waited..and waited and waited some more to the point that people that arrived and got seated after us already paid and left. If it wasn't for the time stamp on my Snapchat photos, nobody would've believed that we waited 30 minutes between our soups and entrees. It was disappointing considering everything started out so great. It also didn't help that our server didn't update us with what was happening. He just did a quick driveby the table to ask us how we were doing without actually hearing our responses. When our entrees arrived, the beef Wellington was actually really good. Unfortunately, my brothers burger and fries was already cold and it was no longer appetizing. We're understanding people so I wished there was better communication between the kitchen, server and us. We were left out in the dark and not really sure as to what was happening. The manager apologized and ended up comping the burger but as a visitor, it's not like we were really able to warm it up somewhere to enjoy it so the meal went to waste. As a Gordon Ramsay establishment, we had some high expectations and we were looking forward to experiencing what quality food and service would be like.

From start to finish. The moment you walk in the doors. Everything was AMAZING.\n\nSo for starters: make a reservation. We made one a month in advance and we were only able to score one time slot. Take whatever you can get because it's truly an experience. Hell's Kitchen has been on my bucket list forever so when they added a Vegas location I was super thrilled. The establishment is exactly what you would feel Gordon would want it to be, which is exceptional. So clean, so modern, and the kitchen was captivating. - We were seated right away and our waitress couldn't have been any better and so helpful with just about everything. \n\nCocktails ordered: Fear & Loathing, Notes from Gordon, & Smoke on the Blvd. All ranging from $16-18 a drink. My husbands was by far the coolest (blvd) it came in a glass case that let out smoke when opened. All of the drinks are hand crafted and made with care. \/ Choosing what to order for my entree was the hardest part. So many good HK choices I wanted to try! Ultimately I went with the Hells Kitchen prix fixe. Three courses of pan seared scallops, beef Wellington, and a dessert. You can also substitute the scallops for a ceaser salad. SO happy I went with this because it was out of this world. I believe it was $75 and $125 if you added a wine pairing. Other meals ordered were the braised short rib and rack of lamb. We also added a shrimp cocktail + side macaroni and cheese. I truly can't stress enough how great everything was. It's rare for me to find somewhere that is absolutely perfect in different ways but that's exactly what this place is. \n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend splurging here! It's so, so worth it! Also the winner of last season was there walking around and greeting tables. Super sweet.","date":"2018-09-19 04:11:13"}

Are you kidding me? This is truly HELL lol.\n\nWe were seated promptly (there was no wait) and we had no reservations. Our server asked us what kind of water we wanted and we said \"still\" because that's what we say at all the other restaurants (because we didn't want the bubbly sparkling water). FATAL MISTAKE!!! Should've said FREE water... I'll get back to this later....\n\nLobster risotto: 5\/5 \nI would come back for this again, it was really good! Rich and creamy, the lobster had a nice bite and wasn't too chewy. I should've just ordered this only. \n\nBraised short rib: 3\/5\nSALTY!! I enjoyed how tender it was, but it made me extremely thirsty and I would have to take a sip of water after pretty much every bite. I still liked it but it was average and not worth the price. I was flying through the glasses of water.\n\nMy friends ordered the beef Wellington and both of them agreed it was dry and disappointing. It was probably the worst thing we tried. \n\nIn comparison, we all enjoyed Gordon Ramsay's Burger (BURGR) way more. Everything there was delicious and didn't taste a dry salt bomb! \n\nSo as I said, we were drinking tons of water because everything was so salty. It felt really strange because our server kept asking us if we wanted another bottle of water (and other restaurants we've dined at never felt so hesitant on bringing us water refills) but we didn't think much of it... UNTIL THE BILL CAME. \n\nWe were shocked that we were charged $8 each for water. It left an extremely bad taste to our mouths (but maybe even that is more appetizing than the salty food lol). My friend took the real L though, she ordered a $15 drink as well so she essentially paid $20+ for two drinks yikes. \n\nIt wasn't until this happened that we noticed other tables didn't have the water bottle... we were so confused! Where did everything go wrong??? Our server never specified what the choices for water was and if we would have known we would be stuck with a $30 charge for WATER we would've asked for clarification. It felt super shady. If the server asks you what kind of water you want, don't say still because apparently that translates to fancy water??  L\n\nI would recommend you to skip this place and head over to Ramsay's other restaurant unless you want to feel like an IDIOT SANDWICH for paying an exorbitant price for water.","date":"2018-09-09 07:29:26"}

I hyped up my bf all week about this establishment and I promised they wouldn't disappoint. I dined in and had reservations on a Saturday (8\/11) @3:15. No issues being sat, no issues with service initially. I did my research and selected to the prix fix menu, which included the scallop appetizer (server's recommendation), beef Wellington and a dessert and ordered my bf a beef dish and lobster risotto. The scallops came out cold. It was supposed to be pan seared which looked like it but temp wise nah. I cringed when we had to inform the server and he respectfully gave us a new batch. 2nd time the charm?? No. Cold again! We asked if it were supposed to come that way and the server said he wasn't sure. He apologized and said he'd take it off the bill as it wasn't up to par. We proceeded to eat the risotto which was the best thing on their menu!! Then the beef Wellington came and again it wasn't hot. Luke warm. I was already over it and decided to eat my bf's dish (short rib dish I believe) which was fresh off the pan, hot and tasted wayyy better than the Wellington, unfortunately. The dessert tasted better than the meal when it came to the 3rd course. Okay so here comes the check, server then states that he cannot remove the scallops off the bill because i ordered off the prix fixed menu. So instead he took off our beer. Uhm what?! Beer is not equivalent to their $22 scallops appetizer! I paid the man and left. Went to the hostess stand and asked to speak to a manager about the situation. She left for a quick min and was told \"they were all in a meeting,\" so she asked for my name and number and was promised a call back. 0 calls came through. After my trip, I even called back twice but was on hold for a while and didn't want to wait any longer. Idk from the other reviews it seems like this place is a hit or miss. It wasn't worth it and I was so disappointed leaving and wish I didn't go in the first place.

I'm honestly surprised it took 17 seasons of the show to finally open a restaurant of the same name.  This is still soft opening so hopefully they'll get the kinks worked out.  Went in on Tuesday 1\/16 and no tables available so I sat at the bar.  Erin was my bartender and she is fantastic, recommended a drink called Smoke on the Blvd and it was great with a really cool presentation.  She and the drinks ultimately made this 4 stars.\n\nThis is where things started to go awry.  I ordered the scallops for an app and was really disappointed For $22, it's 5 halves, so basically 2.5 scallops...wow.  They tasted great and I knew I'd be paying a decent amount for dinner but it just seemed tacky and kind of like something a chain restaurant would do to cut corners.  \n\nFor the entree, I ordered the filet medium and a side of Brussels sprouts.  The filet came out way over cooked and even the bartender noticed that pretty quick and kindly sent it back for me.  They replaced it quickly but honestly, it was just ok.  I've had other filets that have been more flavorful and prepared better.  Sprouts were good, wish the peppers on top would have had a little spice.\n\nThe best part of the meal was dessert.  Definitely recommend the sticky pudding, he's famous for it and it was absolutely delicious!","date":"2018-01-17 17:28:22"}

Throughout the years, I've followed Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares. When I planned my trip to Vegas, Hell's Kitchen was at the top of my list. HK is located at Caesar's Palace and can be seen from The Strip. As you walk towards the front, you're greeted by the HK and pitchfork fire display and that's definitely a place you want to take a picture. As you enter the restaurant, there's a large TV screen, about the size of door, and Chef Ramsay is there to greet you and it's quite amusing. The walls are decorated with the portraits of all the Hell's Kitchen winners. \n\nLet's get to the food! The menu is quite simple, there's a few options for every course. We began with the Scampi Prawn Flambe and it was beyond amazing. The prawns are brought out and they flambe the dish at the table so you get a little show before you dig in. The prawns are seasoned in a garlic white wine sauce and butter. I would recommend getting two of these because one is just not enough! \n\nFor the entrees, my father ordered the famous Beef Wellington and I had the Filet. The Beef Wellington is truly the signature dish at HK. The chefs will only cook it medium rare because this type of beef needs to be tender in order to bring out the flavor of the meat. I had half of the Wellington and it was way more flavorful than my Filet. There was issues with my filet and unfortunately I had to send it back. I always order my steaks medium rare but when it arrived at the table, it was well done. I was also not impressed with the thickness and size of the filet. I looked at the table next to ours and their filet was double the size so I did make it known to our server. When it came back, it was cooked more to a medium but I was starving and I didn't want to send it back again. My advice, stick to the Beef Wellington!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered a Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Pineapple Carpaccio. I have never seen a dessert like the pineapple carpaccio, it is one of the most original presentations I have ever seen. They bring out the fruit on a glass dish and they pour dry ice into the bowl beneath the dish and it creates a cloud of what looks like liquid nitrogen. The fruit is sliced thinly and it's a must have! The stick toffee pudding was rich and sponge-like. After a heavy meal, both desserts hit the spot.\n\nIn terms of service, it was a bit spotty. Our server, John, was nervous but he apologized multiple times for the confusion with the entrees. He was very nice and attentive and I don't blame him for the problems in the kitchen. The kitchen is open so you get to see what's going on in both red and blue kitchens. When I made the reservation, I mentioned it was my dad's 85th birthday and no one said anything nor did they compliment my dad and that was disappointing. Service for me is just as important as food quality so that's why I deducted a star. Prices are what you would expect, expensive! Be prepared to dish out at least $200 for two people. If you're not a fan of Hell's Kitchen, then as Chef Ramsay would say...Fuck off you donkey!","date":"2018-05-22 16:15:48"}

My boyfriend ordered a standard cheeseburger and meatballs for appetizer. Service started off efficient and quick, but began slowing down tremendously as the meal progressed. My pumpkin soup which was delicious was initially brought out with no chorizo, must've confused my order with another. My boyfriend's burger was also wrong, they brought out a Hell's kitchen burger (with the ghost pepper) instead of what was ordered. They corrected it for us and when the server came by she apologized for the mix up and said she would come back to see how his hamburger was. However, she never asked but if she had, we would've told her that the bottom bun was pretty soggy.... a tad disappointing. Ok.... My beef Wellington was SUPERB! I'm still thinking about it months later. I'm usually a ribeye girl but WOW. You have to try it. Meatball appetizer was fine. The sticky toffee dessert was good but not extraordinary, and it's large enough for 3 people to share. Honestly, the service was wonderful aside from all the waiting between dishes. Oh and it didn't help that the table next to us was receiving their food before us when they came and ordered after us, they were also a party of 2.... Not a huge deal but i did notice this.

This is sort of a novelty restaurant with a Hell's Kitchen TV Show theme to it and a sort of Hell's Kitchen kind of menu. You walk in and it almost looks like Gordon Ramsay is there to sort of greet you. As you walk past the hostess desk you see an open kitchen. The winning contestant of the last Hell's Kitchen Cooking Competition TV Show was there working on the line on my visit. You also see light fixtures hanging from the ceiling with pitchforks like from Hell's Kitchen. \n\nFrom my seat I got kind of excited when I saw someone that looked like Gordon Ramsay come out of the kitchen in Chef Whites. It looked like from my seat that Gordon Ramsay was checking on the line. I don't know if they pay someone to look like Gordon Ramsay or if one of the chefs that work there just happen to resemble him???\n\nNow what to order.\n\nI noticed the wine list and it runs very expensive. Your cheapest bottle runs about $70. and it goes up up UP with many bottles running a little under $200..... So we went with cocktails. My husband got maybe the most interesting cocktail. It was called a Smoke on the Blvd. It was presented in a box filled with applewood smoke. It was a very impressive presentation and the drink was indeed smoky!\n\nWe started with two salads that we shared. The Caesar and the Red Quinoa. We both favored the Red Quinoa. It was interesting and different with a little apple, dried apricots, hazelnuts and goat cheese. It was tasty. The Caesar wasn't bad but it was slightly disappointing because it wasn't perfect. The flavors in the dressing were very unbalanced and were mostly lemon. We couldn't taste the garlic, anchovy, black pepper and other flavors it's suppose to have. We told our waiter and he just nodded (not a big-gy).\n\nFor Dinner I was hoping for the John Dory........Don't they always call for a John Dory on the TV Show???? I settled for a Crispy Skin Salmon. The Salmon Skin indeed was CRISPY and seasoned just so and the fish was prepared to a perfect medium. The lentils were seasoned well and the salad was tasty.\n\nMy husband had the Wellington and it came in a crispy pastry and the filet was a perfect medium rare.\n\nI never had Toffee Pudding before or the unusual German Flavored Ice cream before. The Toffee Pudding is like Wet Soaked Cake that is sort of like Molasses flavored. It really wet and very moist and not too sweet. The ice-cream on top is creamy and slightly spiced.\n\nFor the most part everything we tried was prepared reasonably well. I enjoyed the novelty of the restaurant. It was kind of fun. The Smoke on the Blvd Cocktail was impressive. Food wasn't cutting edge but was good.","date":"2018-03-10 12:47:40"}

Just ask Adam and go with whatever he recommends. Seriously. He made our whole vacation and we just started !!!! Adam thank you. I know Alex will remember his 21st forever and you and the Gordon Ramsey team created a memory I am so thankful that my only son got to experience. We will treasure this night always.","date":"2018-08-08 02:23:15"}

We had thought it was supposed to open on Tuesday, which we were leaving & thinking we would miss it. We saw it late Saturday night & found it to be open, but closing for the night. Timbaer the bartender told us to come in the morning as they opened at 11. We showed up about 10 minutes early, waited a few & were the first to be seated that morning \nGreat table in front of the kitchen, so had a great view of the red & blue chefs preparing meals. \nOmar was our server & was fantastic. Very attentive & knowledgeable of the menu. This helped a lot in making a decision, both food & drink. Joanna kept our water glasses filled  (uniquely holding a napkin to prevent splashing) & our table cleared. \nOh yeah, the food. We had the scallops & oysters for an appetizer. All I can say is wow. The scallops were over the top & exceeded expectations. Would have been nice to have whole & not halved, but the flavor more than made up for it. The oysters came with a cocktail sauce & a tasty ginger sauce. They both complimented the oysters very well.\nFor lunch we had the Hell's Kitchen Burger & the Short Rib Grilled Cheese as recommended by one of the bartenders from the night before. \nThe burger was juicy & the ghost pepper jack cheese provided a great zing to it. The short ribs were braised to perfection. The cheese was a great compliment to the tender pieces of meat.  It was a toss up to which was better, but it was one of the best burgers I've had. \nDessert was the sticky toffee pudding as (as recommended by another diner) & the chocolate mousse. The mousse was good, but not real exciting. The sticky toffee pudding was a different story. Simply wonderful!  Moist cake & great ice cream made for a dessert to die for!\nHad to try some of the specialty cocktails. One was the Pitchfork, a bourbon-based cocktail cocktail topped with whipped egg whites & the signature HK logo. Second cocktail was the Chef's Stew. A gin-based cocktail with fruit juices & served in small steel pot. The fun part was the piece of dry ice added to make it bubble. It was two-fold; fun & very tasty. \nWe were so satisfied we went back about dinner time Monday night, a quick seat at the bar where Timbaer again was great. Omar saw us & remembered us so we told him again we appreciated his wonderful service. \nFor our light dinner, we just ordered the lobster risotto.  The lobster was juicy & sweet & paired with risotto perfectly. It was like every bite elicited a wow. We had the Chef's Stew & Pitchfork again, but added The Smoke on the Blvd. This was made with Woodford Rye & actually smoked in a small glass smoker on the bar. Highly recommend. \nAll in all, this visit exceed our expectations 150%  Omar, Joanna & Timbaer were attentative & helpful. They seemed to enjoy working at HK. Only drawback is we didn't get to meet Chef Christina, who we heard is now the general manager of the Ramsay restaurants in Vegas. \nTo sum it up, you need to eat at Hell's Mitchen!","date":"2018-01-16 22:34:19"}

My boyfriend and got the scallops which were delicious and the lobster risotto, the risotto would have been better if the lobster was softer it seemed a little overcooked so it was very chewy.  For our entrees, he ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the braised short ribs.  We both agreed that the braised short ribs were much better it was so tender and so flavorful, I would get this again as well! Overall the food was so good and everything was seasoned well.

Made for just 1 person. I am not a fan of lobster, yet the lobster tail in there was good but the risotto was outstanding so I would order this again. (I would make this an entree. Too little risotto which was sad).\n2) scallops: 5 of them, on the small side, they were good. I thought they were just okay and have had better, but my friend liked them. I would not order this again.\nSalad:\n1) golden beet salad with yogurt and pistachios, etc: I expected more. My friend liked it, and I thought it was okay. I wanted more acidity for the beets... I found it too sweet and underwhelming. I would not order it again. \nEntrees:\n1) My friend and I both ordered the crispy skin salmon. It was pretty good. I enjoyed it. I would probably order it again if I came here as one of the only choices in entrees I was drawn too. \nDessert: \n1) we ordered the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream on top: yummy and not as heavy as I thought it would be. I guess I would order it again if I came again after seeing dessert menu options. \n2) Drip coffee: great coffee! I would order it again. \nWine\n1) they were out of the Chardonnay we wanted (bottle). We got another bottle. The Chardonnay was okay. I would not order it again. \n\nService: great service! Friendly, helpful, welcoming. \nAmbience: we had a reservation and it was for a birthday, specified in the reservation. We were not by the window. I was facing the bar and it felt more like a New York deli than a high end restaurant, and it was way too loud to feel relaxed. \nPrice: without tax, for all ordered, without tip: around $271.00. Not cheap. ( this included a free birthday dessert). \nSo would I come here again? I am a local, so the answer is probably no. It was good, yet far from outstanding. Maybe the hype and popularity of the advertisement for Hell's Kitchen had me expecting way too much, yet I do not think so. I am sure many people are excited to be there because of the show and the chef and the fame related to both. There are way too many other places in Las Vegas with the same price range with way better food and options, and way better ambience.\nStill, I am glad I tried it as the hype has been sorely lessened for me. \nThe restaurant is decent, yet nothing to write home about in my book.\nI am giving this restaurant 3 1\/2 stars. This is why I chose to give it three stars. It is expensive. The reputation, in terms of advertisement and the show, is expected to be flawless or pretty darn amazing. That was not the case. The ambience of the restaurant is way too loud and too informal. Overall, just not impressed. Very disappointed as I expected a lot more. I judge restaurants by whether I would return or not. I simply would not choose to come back here. It was just OK, which signifies three stars.\nOne final point to add is the following: if you are hungry, get appetizers or salad to begin with. There is no bread that comes to your table, no crackers, nothing at the beginning, nor an amuse bouche. Therefore, if you do not feel like waiting for your entrée because you're quite hungry, the appetizers come to the table quickly. \nAs for dress code, there were many people dressed informally as in jeans and T-shirt.","date":"2018-04-09 03:48:01"}

I met that cord to be warm made it taste better than it was still good even though it was cold and wet sitting in the fridge at the hotel . The prefix dinner which is a four course dinner and I've described here is like 72 or $76 I am in a glass of wine to that so it was an additional 20 bucks or so but I didn't want the whole thing if you get a paired wine is 125 hours. If you're in Vegas just pray you can get a reservation because we want to change the time for us and they were so booked a weekend so if you ever think you want to go then plan to head and took call  for reservations before you go. The manager of the restaurant came to talk to us and was so nice he lives in stuffed up at all and then waitresses were so friendly and nice and the greeters you couldn't want for anything if you need something right there and give it yet and have to wait so do you go there. The manager even gave us his card upon our request, his name is Fred Stone.","date":"2018-08-18 18:01:14"}

I have wanted get to this place for a while now, as Gordon Ramsay is one of my favorite television chefs. While I am not giving it five stars This resturant did not disappoint me at all. We had a large size group, which allowed me to get a variety of bites from different foods on the menu. We ordered the hot wings and meatballs for appetizers (which came out with our main course meal unfortunately) and really loved the flavors of these options. The meatballs tasted so fresh and the wings were some of the best I have ever had. I thought the Caesars salad was a bit boring though and the soup was overly salty. I certainly expected better from a place like this and was surprised at the saltiness of the soup given it's favorable review ratings. For the main course meal we had Chicken\/Mushroom Pizza, Prime Rib Grilled Cheese and the Beef Wellington. Most of these items were good, not great, with the exception of the Beef Wellington, which was the best I have ever had.  I loved the atmosphere and social vibe of this place and the television series winners for each year of the show was a very nice decorating touch. The menu also has some really nice signature cocktails that you will enjoy and service was solid as you would expect.","date":"2018-04-12 00:59:33"}

Went for lunch to be sure it wouldn't be overcrowded. Loved the signage with the logo that makes for great souvenir photos. The inner entrance is adorned with photos of past season winners and spots for frames for upcoming lucky winners. I overheard someone say that the menu was compiled recipes from past shows and winners. \n\nOn our way to our seats we could see the cooks running about in a rush preparing dishes reminiscent of being on the show. The layout is open and airy with lots of windows letting in amazing light and nice views of the strip. I order the pumpkin soup flavored with chorizo to start and was not disappointed. Next, for my entree I ordered the seafood tower which was chilled and fresh and complete with lobster, king crab legs, Jonah crab claws, gulf shrimp, oysters, clams and a few noteworthy sauces and my tablemate went for the filet mignon which she described as mediocre. I washed it all down with a non alcoholic watermelon flavored drink that made me not even need dessert. \n\nThis new hot spot is a nice touch to the LV strip and is sure to remain a hit for a while to come.

The restaurant was completely booked for almost all time slots but thankfully I was able to get an early slot for 11:15am on a Sunday. Lunch before hopping on the freeway back to LA sounded good to me. Even if it didn't, it was my only option so I had role with it or go home.\n\nThe decor is nice with the bar just behind the hostess booth near the entrance, the kitchen to the right of the hostess booth and the main dining area in the center. There's also indoor patio seating with a good view of Las Vegas Blvd pointing south of the strip from Caesars Palace on down.\n\nAs always beers were the kick off. After glancing over the menu a few times my heart was set on the prefixed lunch which included a Caesar salad or pumpkin soup, a beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding for $60. I've heard great things prior about Ramsay's beef wellington. Since on the subject of hearing great things, the same can be said for his pan seared scallops so an order was put in for an appetizer. For other plates a Dry aged New York strip and eggs in purgatory were ordered. \n\nOur server was on top of his game! Very attentive, knowledgeable about the dishes and even took the time to stop by for a few laughs. Shortly after placing our orders the plates began to role out.\n\nThe hype surrounding the pan seared scallops is well deserved. I loved the layer of seasonings on top that sort of served as a crust. The pickled Granny Smith apples that came with the scallops are pretty sour by themselves but eating them with the braised bacon lardons balances the tartness. I didn't get a chance to taste the eggs in purgatory but judging how fast my friend ate them, it had to be good haha.\n\nThe pumpkin soup was decent, not much to really write home about. However the chorizo and toasted pepitas in the soup were tasty. The beef wellington was absolutely delicious. From the crust all the way down to the center. The Dry aged NY strip was as equally good and loved the shishito pepper combination. At first I thought there wasn't enough demi-glacé with the NY strip but after asking for more on the side the amount on the plate was perfect. The demi-glacé alone is pungent and can overpower the steak if too much is poured. Just an FYI if you choose to ask for more. \n\nThe sticky toffee pudding tasted exactly the same as the sticky toffee pudding from Ramsay's other restaurant Pub & Grill but is topped with speculoos ice cream rather than sweat cream ice cream. This was expected since both are his recipe. Hot, soft and delicious. I thought using speculoos for a flavor of ice cream was an interesting choice. It tasted just like the cookie as well. \n\nI really enjoyed the meal, my only gripe is the portion for some plates. My beef wellington was pretty small and the same can be said for the scallops. They're too delicious and costly to be served small LOL. That's not to say there aren't heftier items on the menu. All of the burgers I saw passing our table were decent in size and looked mouthwatering. So did a few other plates I saw being delivered to other tables. \n\nIf you're a fan of Gordon Ramsay, Gordon Ramsay's cooking, a fan of the Hell's Kitchen show, or are just curious about the food...I recommend giving it a shot. I plan to make many returns but for much more special occasions. \n\nLunch 1\/28\/2018","date":"2018-03-08 22:12:36"}

I reserved a table for 3 on a Monday a month in advance and couldn't WAIT to try this! I was so so excited. I've heard from many people that it's great or that they've also heard great things about this place. \n\nLet me tell y'all one thing, the service was impeccable which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of less. The food was definitely mediocre. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n- Wagyu Meatballs\n- Seared Foie Gras\n- Scallops\n- Crispy Skin Salmon\n- Beef Wellington\n- Mushrooms side.\n- Toffee Sticky Pudding\n\nWe first only ordered two appetizers to begin, but our waiter INSISTED we get the Wagyu meatballs and that it's his favorite. He was totally raving about it, and after seeing how SMALL portioned our first two appetizers were, we decided to order it after all. I joked with my brother and boyfriend and said \"watch it tastes like regular meatballs haha\" AND IT DID! You could definitely tell they made their meatballs because it was falling apart when being eaten. It didn't hold, the sauce tasted like any other marinara sauce. Although, I did enjoy the breaded mozzarella. \n\nScallops were basic \n\nThe Seared Foie Gras was really good though! Beautifully presented. Although not anything special. \n\nThe beef Wellington was the hugest disappointment. I've only had beef Wellington at one other spot, which was Mon Ami Gabi located at Paris. That one was WAY better. The server mentioned to us that the beef Wellington is always served medium rare. It was served to us medium well(ington). It was really dry, and it wasn't because of the pastry. Tasted plain, flavorless and downright disappointing. \n\nThe Toffee Sticky Pudding was delicious but a bit over sweet in my opinion. I have recently cut back on a lot of sugar, so this could be the reason why I (out of the 3 of us) was the only one that thought this. It was still really good and I do recommend this dessert.","date":"2018-07-12 08:40:19"}

Well I give you 3 BEYOND Amazing and far surpassing ANY and ALL the expectations we had!!! Amazing services they knew it was our Anniversary not just the hostess but the waiters as well and even Chef Michelle came out and wished us a Happy Anniversary and heard we were fans of the show!! Now to the Food!! Appetizer wise The lobster risotto was amazing!! Perfectly seasoned and the lobster was perfectly cooked!! The same can be said of the scallops! For the Main dish, it's not Hells Kitchen without the Beef Wellington!! PERFECTLY cooked and melt in your mouth delish!!! The toffee desert was just as perfect; and because it was our Anniversary, they brought out a Pineapple coconut desert that was also a eye catcher! So, to sum it all up this was by far the best restaurant experience my other half and I have ever had in our lives!! Chef Ramsey should be proud of this location as it lives up to his Amazing Standards!!","date":"2018-09-10 04:15:59"}

I heard they're pretty booked through June.  There are random times that are available and you may get lucky checking day of for a spot that opened up. They also have seating at the bar which was completely full when we arrived at 5:30, but we found a couple of spots when we came back later for drinks at 9:30. \n\nWe were fortunate to get a reservation at 5:30 on Sunday, but did have a little trouble finding the way to the entrance. We had our Uber driver drop us off at Caesars and then we cut across the circle driveway towards Hells kitchen, but didn't see a pathway. There is a pathway to the left of the fountains or you can walk along the outside of Caesars heading south and walking past Absinthe to get in the front door. That seems to be the most direct route. Just don't try a short cut like we did!\n\nWe were seated right away and given the choice of two tables. There are some tables with strip or fountain views, so you may want to request to reserve those. The space is open and modern. We had a tabletop right by a pillar and there was. I other table right next to us, so it felt a little private. \n\nDana was our server and she was excellent. She went over the menu with us and made recommendations and suggested alternatives when needed (the Wellington sounded great, but I don't like my meat rare). I could see her working a lot of tables, but she was on top of the service and friendly. \n\nWe started with cocktails:  Smoke on the Boulevard (such a cool presentation...everyone around us was checking it out) and Notes from Gordon and enjoyed both. \n\nFor appetizers, we did the smoked beets (unique presentation) and lobster risotto. Our entrees were the Beef Wellington and Short Rib. We ordered a side of Mac and Cheese, but the entrees came with small sides and we ended up stuffed. All of the food was so delicious!  I honestly didn't think we'd be able to eat one more bite, but Dana told us we couldn't miss the sticky toffee pudding and there's always room for dessert. She was right!  Don't skip that!  \n\nWe had to leave by 7:15 for a show, but we enjoyed our experience so much that we came back for another drink at the bar after the show. Another Smoked Boulevard and Chef's Stew which caught my attention when I saw it earlier. Love a cool presentation!  \n\nThis place was worth the hype for us.","date":"2018-02-14 23:08:42"}

I asked for bread and the server took a while to go to the kitchen and then return to tell me they don't have any available.  I thought I saw another table receive some, but I could have been mistaken so I'll let that pass.  As for the food, presentation was good, but taste was hit or miss.  The thing that stuck with me was that I kept tasting a lot of salt, and I mean a lot.  But the food was cooked well and textures were good.  I just could have appreciated it more if the seasoning was taken down a notch.  The highlight was the sticky toffee dessert.  How they make such a large looking cake be so light in taste and texture is amazing.  \n\nNot sure if I would go back, but it is entertaining for people watching.

The scallops were delicious!  The beef wellington was good, but we were disappointed that the outside was soggy.  And the drinks were, well, a bit odd.  By far and away the most pleasant surprise of the whole meal was the dessert - pudding, the English way!  All in all, a satisfying meal, particularly for a cooking show junkie like me!","date":"2018-03-11 19:31:04"}

The restaurant sits in the former location of Serendipity (a former favorite guilty-pleasure stop when in town).  The decor is sleek and modern; the kitchen area is set up just like the show with kitchen staff clad in the red and blue team colors and the remaining staff are dressed in modern attire that is reflective of the environment.  The dining area is a mixture of generous booths and table\/chairs seating nearer to the overlook of the Strip.  \n\nWe arrived a little early for our reservation so we killed some time at the bar.  Our bartender was friendly and knowledgeable.  My husband and I both settled on beer -  Innes and Gun Scottish Ale (which the bartender casually mentioned was Chef Ramsey's favorite).  The hostess fetched us from the bar and escorted us to our table with a fabulous view.  The restaurant was absolutely packed, especially for a Wednesday night.  \n\nOur waiter seemed only moderately interested in waiting on us and the surrounding tables - my husband and I frequent high-end restaurants and it wasn't the wait staff experience to which we are accustomed.  We chose to forego the prix fixe option and ordered lobster risotto as an appetizer.  We followed with the 8 oz filet and beef wellington along with mac and cheese.  No bread service is offered which is a bit offputting at an establishment where the average entree is $50+.  \n\nThe best part of the dining experience was the risotto.  It was creamy, flavorful, and the lobster was perfectly prepared.  The filet and Wellington were both overcooked and fell flat.  The macaroni and cheese was flavorful but the prosciutto tasted and had the mouthfeel of Bacon Bits.  We were both so underwhelmed by our entrees that we chose to skip dessert.  The waiter didn't seem interested in assuring we were satisfied with our meal and it's apparent that this establishment is relying on their tourist appeal.  I'm hoping that once business slows down the quality improves.  Our experience wasn't so poor that we would never try it again, but we certainly had higher expectations out of a Ramsey-branded establishment.","date":"2018-08-19 02:42:31"}

The beef Wellington was so tender and tasty. The Mac n cheese was incredible, however we did have to send back my partners filet, and my Mac n cheese because they were luke warm and cold. On a side note, the Mac n cheese was still the best I've ever had, even being not hot haha. \n\nOur waitress Kerry handled everything very well. She was sweet and nice about it and apologized. I get it, I used to be a server so mistakes happen. The food didn't take long to come right back out, and both were hot. Kerry did great on making sure we were okay, she took care of us very well. Also was very nice for the manager (I believe she was at least), to come by a couple times to make sure everything was okay too. The reason why Im still giving 5 stars even after some of the food was cold, was because how the restaurant handled the problem. Kerry made sure the food came out super quick so we didn't have to wait long. Having the manager come over to check on us was honestly really nice. They bounced back from the mistake very well, so that's why I'm still giving them a 5 Star review.

The chicken was juicy and the sauce was to die for. The salmon skin was so perfectly crispy that I, someone who doesn't like salmon, want to eat even more of it. Also, if you've ever wanted baked Mac and cheese but never the too creamy, almost sickeningly heaviness of it, then order a bunch of Mac and cheese sides at HK. There's a great balance of lightness and creaminess to it that I'm probably going to dream about it until I go back.\n\nOur server, Miguel, was pleasant, kind, and not overwhelming in any way like most other restaurants.

Everything else was business as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing mind blowing either. I have my overall review down below if you want to skip all the details. Here we go:\n\nI ordered three appetizers: scallops, \"wagyu\" meatballs, and tuna tartar. \n\nThe tartar was as perfect of a dish as you can get: a little sweet, a little spice, a little crunch. I like the taro chips it was served with. Very clean and fresh dish. Mouth watering. \n\nI loved ALMOST everything about the scallops too. Perfect sear, super flavorful celeriac purée, and nice clean garnishes like pickled apples. My single issue with the dish is that you are served five HALVED scallops. Oy vay. Why oh why are you cutting these delicate, beautiful pillows of the sea in half? Naturally, they were a bit over cooked. But again, the flavor was on point. No doubt about that. \n\nAnd finally we have the \"wagyu\" meatballs. So here we have meatballs: a poor man's food, traditionally made with cheaper cuts of meat. In my opinion, using something as special as wagyu beef in such a dish is preposterous, over indulgent and almost sacrilegious. The exquisite flavor of such a special piece of meat is lost in all the spices and sauce and cheese that are also in there. Wagyu should take center stage of any dish where it's an ingredient. It should be cooked simply, not ground into meatballs and braised in a spicy, rich tomato sauce. That being said, the flavor was...well they were meatballs and they tasted like meatballs. Delicious, but nothing special...and nothing a beautiful Italian Nonna couldn't make better. \n\nOVERALL:\nAtmosphere - sleek, modern, trendy, beautifully designed\n\nStaff - friendly, a little robotic, starchy and gimmicky, but definitely knowledgeable and eager to please\n\nDrinks - great wine list and beautifully crafted cocktails using fresh squeezed juice to order. You can definitely notice the difference. \n\nFood - flavor and seasoning spot on. For more details, see above. \n\nFinal thoughts - for a restaurant that's been open less than a month, bravo! Plating and menu descriptions need a little work (forgot to say that the menu is kind of a snoozer). I was definitely more impressed than I thought I would be. Kudos to the chef and BOH and FOH teams for a job well done! Congrats on a successful opening!","date":"2018-01-16 19:47:04"}

Tuna was great quality and the marinade was tangy and delicious\n-Shrimp cocktail- pretty big sized shrimp and was seasoned very well, seemed like a pretty average shrimp cocktail \n-Crispy skinned salmon- this was my personal favorite plate of the night. The salmon was delicious and the sauce that was underneath converging the lentils was so refreshing, I couldn't get enough of it \n-Beef Wellington- very good but also very rich and heavy. I personally preferred the salmon, but really just because the salmon was lighter and tasted a little brighter imo. \n\nAnd For dessert: \n-Sticky toffee pudding- fits the delicious description of all other reviews! The speculoos ice cream was a perfect addition! \n-Pineapple carpaccio- really cool presentation and really yummy, feel to the side when compared with the sticky toffee pudding, but if you want a light fruity dessert, I would definitely recommend this","date":"2018-05-23 00:21:33"}

That was an incredible meal. I booked lunch at Hells Kitchen using the Open Table app. We arrived 20 minutes early but were quickly sat down to our seat. Inside the restaurant has the feel of the television show with red and blue kitchens and a nice ambiance. \n    But let's talk about the food and drinks. My wife and I started off with cocktails. We both had a Smoke on the Boulevard. It is brought out to you in a boxes filled with Cherry Wood smile. You pull the drink out and begin to drink one of the most satisfying and smooth whiskeys you have ever tasted. We also had a Chefs Stew. Which was a citrus beer type cocktail served in a chilled pot that bubbles as you drank its eternal goodness. And finely the Notes from Gordon. All cocktails were incredible and made me feel as good as Baby Jesus being born.\n     Our appetizers consisted of the Scallops, half dozen oysters, and the lobster risotto. The scallops had a peas, fennel, and bacon with it. So damn good. I wanted to lick the plate but that would look awkward. The lobster risotto was great but slightly underwhelming. Rice needed a few kore minutes and it was rich. Still great. Surprisingly the oysters were most memorable. So fresh, salty, and orgasmic in the mouth. I swear Ariel, the little mermaid herself, plucked those oysters from the sea just for me so suckle it's shelly goodness like a starving puppy begging for mommy's teat.\n    For our entrees we had the Salmon and the Braised Short rib. Both were excellent choices. Salmon was perfect, from the buttery meat to the crispy skin. I engulfed it all. The sauce was so good. Though I didn't care much for the lentils. I had some of the wife's short rib and it was as delicious as rib meat can every reach. The polenta and side veggies were also a nice added touch.\n     And finally dessert consisted of the sticky toffee pudding. Third Ramsay restaurant where I have tried it and they each had subtle differences. One of the best desserts you will ever have. The pudding, the caramel, and the ice cream will all make you feel like your taste buds just made sweet love to the gods of desserts. \n     If you can get a reservation and have money to spare on a great meal, do yourself a favor and stop by here. Pretty sure you will not regret it. And if you can save me a seat and offer to treat me even better. Cause hot damn I still dream of that meal","date":"2018-07-12 19:25:22"}

Two strands uncut in there and my tastebuds were in love), Beef Wellington (ordered this because I've seen a HK episode where they made these. I wasn't a fan of the pate, but the puff pastry wrapped around it was good. The beef was good perfect! Came with mashed potatoes and carrots), and then Sticky Toffee Pudding (not a fan of sticky pudding, but wow this one was good! It was like having coffee as an after dinner treat. It was spongy, warm and came with Speculoos ice cream). My mom ordered Dry Aged NY Strip and had it done medium and it was cooked just right). We ordered the lobster risotto for an appetizer. Tried saving some for my mom's steak, but it was too good to let sit there.\n\nFor drink, besides water, I ordered the strawberry peach tea. I was thinking it would be a teabag from a box like every restaurant does, but nope...it was beautifully delivered in a clear glass tea pot so I could watch the tea flower pod open up slowly. Beautiful to watch while waiting for your food. Hahah.

Greeted you but then pretty much ignored you until your table ready. The people bringing you to the table stood in line right next too you. In line! No conversation. Very awkward.  We live in vegas, we understand at work you talk shop and other stuff at work but not right next to guest. One of the people did not speak English great and was looking for the next reservation. Atmosphere pretty typical of Gordon here at Las Vegas, loud, every noise bounces off and music loud. Server was great. Manager was bad over polite in a bad way. Asked how things were going I said my knife( which wasn't a steak knife) which they give you wasn't doing the job, brought me a \" steak knife\" which was duller than the knife I had. I actually showed my server and the manager running the steak knife across my hand serial times 10 or more and it didn't cut my hand. It was actually embarrassing.  But they comped a whole bunch for that. On a good note appetizer were awesome fois gras awesome and the lobster risotto. Ribeye ok, beef Wellington good but over cooked. Asked for medium rare. Mushroom side good but onions over rid the mushroom flavor. Mac and cheese okay. Potatoes au gratin great. Desert okay. The sticky pudding not like the others Ramsey restaurants. This was more like cake. But the coffee choice was great. Intelligentsia.  Good choice. Good coffee. I get this shipped to my house every month. Overall food was hit and miss.

Two of the four of us ordered the pre-fixe menu (scallops, wellington, pudding), but at the end of the meal each of us couldn't believe we even thought about paying the a la carte price of the Beef Wellington. The combination of Hell's Kitchen's dull (steak?) knives + the extra chewy wellington basically shoots the steak from the puff pastry every single time you try to get both in the same bite.\n\nScallops were tougher and smelled fishier than we were used to.\n\nLobster Risotto, Mac & Cheese, Toffee Pudding and the service are the silver lining to an otherwise bland visit.\n\nFor a place to get small dishes and appetizers, sure, Hell's Kitchen is worthwhile if other restaurants don't have the space.\n\nIt seems more like a marketing gimmick than a fine dining experience to me.

The scallops were just a touch of crispness followed but a melt in your mouth perfectly cooked scallop. The beef Wellington is so tender it can be cut easily with a butter knife and the demi glace was a perfect complement to the dish. The pudding was moist, the ice cream was sweet and salty and I'm still thinking about it. Overall, all other food is now ruined because it will never be as delicious as the food at Hell's Kitchen.

I find that presumption odd as it is my husband's dessert - not mine. They never asked if we are sharing beforehand. Also, that's the \"birthday\" treat I got from them - a candle on my husband's dessert - and that was it. \nOther than that, everything was great. Good food all around.","date":"2018-06-16 09:42:36"}

For our main we ordered the tomahawk steak for two,  we asked for medium rare and that's exactly what we got, perfectly cooked and nicely seasoned the steak had been removed from the bone and sliced and was accompanied by a perfectly baked garlic clove, roasted tomatoes and forest mushrooms.

First up the staff are great from the hostesses to the food runners to the waiters, simply fantastic. Our waiter Michael R thoroughly went over the entire menu which is not that big. Seating was horrible, it reminded of Lawry's with the open cafeteria feel which i hate unless its a buffet, not appropriate for an upscale expensive restaurant. Tables so close your chair is constantly being hit or you're ducking to accommadate the servers passing by. Now most of the food was delicious, what there was of it. We tried to order a variety so we could get a taste of everything and share. Dinner for 3.\nAppetizers\nLobster risotto $24- lobster was over cooked and tough. And was served in the most shallow bowl i have ever seen, it was about 5 spoonfuls.\n Scallops, came with my prixe fix $69 beef wellington dinner-dont be fooled by the pics where it looks like u get 5, they are cut in half so u only get 2 and a half, im so glad our waiter told us this so we could order more apps.\n3 sodas $15\nBeef wellington only comes 1 way, medium rare, they do not take request, i was hesitant when our waiter informed us of this since that was my main reason for coming, and i dont like my meat bloody. I ordered it anyway it didnt look good because it was so red but it was delicious thanx to the seasoning of the duxelle.\nRack of lamb $39- only 3 pieces but tender and juicy but no flavor.\nBraised short ribs $34- this dish was the best for the money, hearty and full of flavor.\nSticky toffee pudding came with my meal-for some reason it was huge, to me this is where they couldve held back it was so big we couldnt even finish it\nThis is a place with no salt & pepper at the table and the food was soooo lacking in flavor i wish i were one of those ppl that carried seasoning in my purse lol.

Yes please! I love how a fresh avocado gives a cool, creamy, satisfying texture to any burger.\n\nThe HK burger is accompanied by house fries which were tasty but not terribly crispy.\n\nThe fresno pepper jam & jalapeños with the spicy aioli had a slow but evident heat that crept up on me. \n\nGood thing I love spicy food because after adding the jalapeños & aioli to my burger, it had a wicked kick!!\n\nThe brioche bun was soft & fluffy.\n\nMy burger was moist & seasoned perfectly.

I had slice of capicola which was salty, in a delectable way, & delicious!\n\nThe BF ate the whole pizza, so one can only infer that he enjoyed it... Shocking...

I say this because a couple that was at the bar complained about people using the word Hell & feeling like the devil was present. Strange that they would come here to eat...

I did the 3 course lunch special for $60.  The first course of white asparagus soup came out completely cold (to the point where I almost thought it was intentionally served chilled until I spoke to the waiter about it and he quickly took it away and was clearly embarrassed and apologetic), he replaced it with a mediocre caesar salad.  The 2nd course was by far the biggest disappointment.  The half-order (like 3-4 bites) of the overcooked and underseasoned Beef Wellington that was served with ice cold (again) mashed potatoes was completely underwhelming.  I remain unconvinced that even if these dishes were executed perfectly that they would warrant the $60 and be considered good value, probably not.  The toffee dessert as the 3rd course was excellent and somewhat anticlimactic after the poor performance earlier. Gordon better have a long talk with Michelle about this restaurants performance.  If you can sit at the bar and not have to wait forever to get your reserved table, and can just order the desert, this might not be a bad move.

Ordered the drink 'notes from Gordon' was peachy, refreshing and had a cute note from Gordon Ramsay!  The wagyu meatballs were so tasty, as was the lobster risotto. I saw several tables order the risotto as a main dish, we ordered it as an appetizer for the table. The short rib dinner I had was tender and flavorful. Our table also ordered the beef Wellington, that was amazing as well. Our waiter, John, found out it was my birthday and was kind enough to give me a complimentary sticky toffee dessert. It was large enough to share with our party of six. Portions were generous, no leaving hungry! Last year my family and I ate at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant in the Paris hotel in Las Vegas. How nice to know his restaurants live up to his high standards!!","date":"2018-07-29 17:47:52"}

There's a big HK outside that has flames on a timer at night. It's set up like set with the blue and red kitchens open to the dining area. \n\nWe had early lunch reservations but we probably could have just walked in. By the time we left there was a bit of a queue for a table. \n\nBe prepared to spend a bit of money, especially if you order big entrées and the signature dishes. The sides are extra also. If you order the strip steak and two sides you're dropping $70 right there without an app or drinks. \n\nOur server was terrific, very helpful and took the time to talk to us and about the restaurant. He took extra care of my elderly parents and made the event special. The rest of the waitstaff was extremely attentive and pleasant. \n\nI ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which was very flavorful and delicious. It came with fries that were very good. My partner ordered the wild mushroom pizza. It was very tasty and the crust was perfect. We also ordered the pan-seared scallops. They were good but they were a little burnt and probably wouldn't have made it to our table if Chef Ramsey had been at the pass. Lol!\n\nMy partner is a Hell's Kitchen superfan and since our server took the time to find that out - After our meals he surprised my partner with an introduction to Michelle Tribble, the winner of season 17 (All-Star season) and executive chef at the restaurant. She came out to greet Chris and then took some photos with her. We were so tickled! It was worth the trip just for that experience. Only Gordon Ramsey himself could have made it better.","date":"2018-06-03 20:44:25"}

I was excited to find out that this restaurant recently just opened a couple of months ago. Like I usually do, I scope restaurants through yelp and one by one I check out their menu. Their menu was not extensive and it was not extremely pricy as well. \n\nMade a reservation on a Thursday night, as I assume it would be a popular spot to go because 1. it's new and 2. because it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We got there half hour early before our reservation. There was a line to check in. When it was our turn, the hostess could not find my reservation. She asked me for my last name and the time I reserved a table. Nothing. She asked me for a confirmation number, I showed her on my phone. Little did I know, I had accidentally reserved a table a week later. I had a mini panic attack in disbelief I made a mistake for like a minute (that felt like forever.) Especially that we have a show to go to right after dinner. Anyway, I asked the hostess politely if there is any way we can still grab a table, she looked through her computer and said she only has a high top. (in my head, \"shoot even if it's the bar area, we'll take it\") I was delighted that we were still able to sit and have dinner.\n\nOur server was nice and I feel like she would have been more attentive if it was not a busy night. All the other food runners and servers that touched our table was also very pleasant. It is such a big deal for us to feel comfortable at a restaurant because we are a lesbian couple. (trust me, you would think people would be more accepting of us now. However the mere act of holding hands while walking down a block captures so many pair of eyes and glances smh. Sorry got sidetracked)\nSo overall the tone was friendly. The restaurant was slightly dimmed designed with pitchforks hanging from the ceiling. I also really liked the idea of the kitchen. It's as if you're in the actual show. Their staff is more than happy to take a picture for you in front of the kitchen.\n\nMy girlfriend and I each got our own cocktails. I must say their cocktails are good and strong. You get what you paid for. They have a short list of house cocktails with funny names. Then they also have the extensive cocktail list and wine list. \n\nNow the food, the food was not the greatest. It wasn't bad either. We ordered the Prawn scampi that was flambéed on our table. (That was cool but the shrimp was salty) then the girlfriend ordered the Wellington and I had the Filet. Both steaks were perfectly cooked medium rare as we requested. The filet was delicious, the wellington was ok (slightly disappointing as it was one of the highlights). We also ordered mushrooms and brussels sprouts as our sides. The side portions were perfect, not too much not too little. They paired well with our steaks. \n\nNow when we ordered we informed our server that we have a show to go to right after. Our food was well timed starting from when the first course came. However on my reservation I had put that it's my girlfriend's birthday, also discreetly mentioned it to our server. I was at least expecting a small ice cream or even just a greeting but maybe it was forgotten. It wasn't a big deal. It just would have been nice if a little something was done with the information in hand. Anyway we finished our meal with still an hour to spare before our show. We left happily and full. Would we go back? Sure why not, we would like to try something else on the menu and hopefully I reserve the right date next time.","date":"2018-03-21 22:53:19"}

The shrimp were fair to midland, the lobster was decent and the oysters were playing peek a boo with me.  I had to turn on my cell phone light just to find the oysters. Never have I seen oysters that small.  Ok, now moving on I ordered the New York strip with a side of Roasted Cauliflower.  The NY strip was the only steak I have ever not been able to finish. In fact it was so bad that I left over half of it and ate chex mix on the way back to my hotel room. When I say bad let me explain...If you like a dry steak with absolutely no flavor that has no tenderness whatsoever then this is the steak for you! My pallet was pissed off at me when we left this joint!  Seriously...I give this restaurant a 1 star only because the Mac N cheese was decent but you can throw crumpled up bacon bits over a dog tird and it will taste good....Of all the losses I have had in Vegas this one hurt the most.

Started out with the Meatballs and crispy polenta croutons, delicious!! Also had the scallops, pretty thin, and a little cold, flavor was good. Then we moved onto the beef short rib over a creamy polenta, very good, could have you may a pinch more of salt. My wife had the Beef Wellington which agains was a little on the cold side but the flavor was there. For dessert of course we had the sticky toffee bread pudding, the best dessert ever!!!","date":"2018-02-08 05:23:22"}

We liked that they offer many of the same items for lunch and dinner. We had lobster risotto among other selections the first two days. There was only one dessert option which I thought was strange. My food was cold the third time we visited. He ordered pizza which takes a little longer, so my guess is they don't really have their timing down and my food cooled down while waiting. The restaurant itself is nicely but simply decorated. The view of the city is the best part though. It's ideal for people watching which is especially nice in Vegas with all the costumes and such.","date":"2018-03-21 02:23:21"}

The decor is so much like the show.  It is very loud in there.  There is the main dining area where you can see the red and blue kitchen cooking. Hells kitchen winner Michelle was working nice to see her if you are a fan of the show.  I was seated on the tables that were by the windows not in the main dining area. Beautiful view. My server was Omar. I ordered the beef wellington which I was told was cooked med rare.   When it arrived it seemed to be cooked med well. I mentioned this to my server and he told me that it was the lightning. Mind you i was by a floor to ceiling glass window and it was sunny. He agreed to take it back and have another done for me. A couple of minutes later he arrived at my table and told me to follow him. He walked me through the entire main dining area to the front pass to PROVE to me that my food under different lighting looked different. What the hell!!  I was mortified especially bring a solo diner it was totally embarrassing.  The chef at the pass said we will gladly refire another one.  I daid i have no idea why he paraded me up here and it was not worth the embarrassment or worth this lengthy discussion.  I then had to walk all the way back to my table though the main dining area to my table completely embarrassed.  Another server brought out my dinner and apologized profusely.  Wellington was delicious!! My waiter Omar then came to see if I would like desert. It was very noisy and he started to explain the desserts. He mentioned the sticky toffee pudding and then said something else which I could not hear over the loud noise. I agreed to which i thought was sticky toffee pudding.  Another server brought my dessert and it was something totally different. I mentioned to her that I thought it was sticky toffee pudding and she said I will gladly change it right away.  While she was gone to get my dessert the waiter Omar came to my table and decided it was a good idea to belittle me by reciting our dessert conversation back to me 3 times. I said it's not worth arguing over and it must have been a miscommunication. He left my table another server brought my sticky toffee pudding and apologized to me and it wasnt even her fault. Dessert was so delicious!!  When I was finished he walked up to my table dropped the bill and never said a word to me. I have been to all of Gordon Ramseys vegas restaurants and loved every minute of them. This one the food was wonderful but the waiter was HORRENDOUS!!! I have never complained about a restaurant in my 50+ years but by the same token I have never been belittled by a wait person ever.

The lunch portion was $60 while the dinner would have cost $69.

Ok..i know scallops are expensive but for $22 we expected to get more the one scallop.\n\nThe lobster risotto had a less then 3 oz lobster with undercooked 2 oz of risotto.\n\nThe birthday dessert was the best part of the meal.

My boyfriend ordered a standard cheeseburger and meatballs for appetizer. Service started off efficient and quick, but began slowing down tremendously as the meal progressed. My pumpkin soup which was delicious was initially brought out with no chorizo, must've confused my order with another. My boyfriend's burger was also wrong, they brought out a Hell's kitchen burger (with the ghost pepper) instead of what was ordered. They corrected it for us and when the server came by she apologized for the mix up and said she would come back to see how his hamburger was. However, she never asked but if she had, we would've told her that the bottom bun was pretty soggy.... a tad disappointing. Ok.... My beef Wellington was SUPERB! I'm still thinking about it months later. I'm usually a ribeye girl but WOW. You have to try it. Meatball appetizer was fine. The sticky toffee dessert was good but not extraordinary, and it's large enough for 3 people to share. Honestly, the service was wonderful aside from all the waiting between dishes. Oh and it didn't help that the table next to us was receiving their food before us when they came and ordered after us, they were also a party of 2.... Not a huge deal but i did notice this.

Whoever thought pumpkin soup can have such synergy with Spanish pork? \n\nBad:\n\nIt goes all downhill from there. Ordered the famous beef Wellington and it was incredibly dry and the pastry fell off the beef immediately. My waiter convinced me to try this as it differs from the beef Wellington at Steak. In fact he told me every chef Gordon Ramsey restaurant has their own take on it.\n\nHe was right. This take was quite terrible. The mashed potatoes tasted to quote Ramsey himself 'bland' and felt like it was whipped with little to no butter.\n\nOver fifty dollars for this.

During the waiters introduction of the menu and our ordering he kept looking around, over his shoulder, to the left, to the right, behind himself - anywhere but at us.

It was amazing to say the least. The staff was beyond wonderful and the foot made every bite like a small piece of heaven. Each cocktail is beautifully crafted to give a unique yet familiar experience. I think the cocktail \"Note from Gordon\" was one of my favorites. It was a big drink, and it comes with a little note in the garnish that made me laugh.\n\nOn to the layout. The room still has the feel of Serendipity when it was there, but it was nicely updated to give the feel that you're in the show. The kitchen is divided into the red and blue team, but instead of fighting each other, they work to create a perfect experience.\n\nTry the scallops appetizer. I would have never thought apples with scallops but dang it's delicious! I could eat so many of those and make that a full meal.\n\nThe lobster risotto comes with a whole butter poached lobster tail and is cooked to perfection. It's not a huge portion by any means, but it's still a great entree size.\n\nThe New York is great but I feel it was missing something that set it over the edge. Maybe a little more sauce or some extra of the mushrooms\/peppers that come on top. One way or another, it was still better than a lot of steaks I've had in this city.\n\nSides... get the Mac and cheese, and the cauliflower. I don't care if you typically don't like those items... these ones are life changing. I finished both of those off before I even touched anything else.\n\nOverall, it's quite the experience and very delicious! One of the best points right now is the price is relatively cheap. Still expensive, but way cheaper than what I was expecting. I'm sure it will increase in price, so go now before it goes up!","date":"2018-01-05 06:27:56"}

First off, we must have sat there at least 10 minutes before anyone came over to wait on us, which was funny because the girl who waited on us sure found time to sit and chit chat with her co-workers instead of waiting on the clientele. For some reason, after she gave us our water, we ended up with a different server and he was very good.\n\nDecided to try the 3-course meal that included a scallop appetizer, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding.  The scallop entree was fine - nothing to write home about. The portion of beef wellington was quite generous and I could hardly finish it.  It was good, not mind blowing. I honestly wasn't wowed until they served the sticky toffee pudding.  Excellent - yum.  Now I've had sticky toffee pudding before and never understood why people raved about it, but now I do.  It was a generous portion and you can bet I ate the whole thing.  I didn't care that I was stuffed to the gills, I was going to finish every crumb.  \n\nThe girl who won Hell's Kitchen served us our entrees, I think because they knew it was my birthday.  Didn't matter to me who served my meal because I didn't watch this season of Hell's Kitchen.\n\nFunny thing was we had walked there in sneakers and changed to shoes in the bathroom.  After dinner we went back in the bathroom to change back into our sneakers and realized my daughter's were missing.  She must have forgotten to give them to me when we left the bathroom initially.  I went up to the front counter, and asked if someone had found them.  They had thrown them out behind the bar, fished them out of the garbage and gave them to me (they were wet).  I thought it was funny, and wasn't upset about this at all, just grateful they were retrieved.  They really should have put them in lost and found.","date":"2018-05-16 18:54:33"}

Very similar to the show, no table in there though. Our server Garvin (I hope I'm remembering that right) was awesome! He explained the whole menu, how everything worked. Made some recommendations. And when my limited wine drinking friend ask for a type of wine she likes that wasn't on the menu, he went over and above to come up with other suggestions of something she might like. Even went to the back of the house a few times and came out with different bottles he thought she might enjoy. Did not appear to be 'put out' as some servers in these nicer restaurants can be. We had the meatball appetizer, delish! Everything on the menu looked awesome. The presentation of everything we saw come out of the kitchen was on point! The chicken piccata was moist and tender and the braised beef rib sandwich was deluxe! They have a Pre Fixe menu as well that was actually reasonably price and not much more expensive on the dinner menu. For dessert we shared the famous Sticky Toffee!! Oh my goodness!! Ending with amazing cup of coffee! Probably the best 'fancy' lunch I've ever had! At the end of the meal, Manager Pete came over to chat us up, the place was rocking but he took the time to chat w us as we told him how much we love all the GR restaurants, especially Steak and Burger!

I got the prix fixe dinner, which comes with seared scallops (fresh and flavorful), the beef Wellington (pretty good), and the sticky toffee pudding. The portion is not as big as the TV show has shown, and the service is kind of slow... So gotta knock down 1 star for that. Overall, the price is not bad considering it being in Vegas and it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I would definitely come back just for dessert. Worth a try!","date":"2018-02-18 20:14:02"}

I planned my whole trip to Las Vegas to try out the food in Hell's Kitchen and the food did not disappoint! If you plan on dining here, please make a reservation ahead of time so that you won't have to wait that long because there are a lot of tourists. When we entered, we were greeted by Gordon Ramsay on screen and there were merchandises that could be purchased. I really liked the Hell's Kitchen concept of this restaurant and how everyone was welcoming. We ordered the lobster risotto for appetizer, followed by the beef Wellington and roasted rack of lamb as main entree. I can certainly vouch that the lamb sauce was excellent! The lamb itself was tender and the meat melted in my mouth while the sauce complimented the fattiness of the meat. The beef Wellington was also delicious and this was my first time eating a proper one. The pastry was flaky and the medium rare beef melted in my mouth like butter. We ended our meal with the sticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream. I am a big fan of speculoos and I really enjoyed how it complimented the pudding. Moreover, our waiter was very attentive and even replaced our notes from Gordon cocktail which my boyfriend was not fond of with the smoke on the blvd cocktail which he enjoyed. We also managed to take a photo with Michelle Tribble, the winner of Hell's Kitchen All Stars. Overall, I highly recommend anyone who enjoy eating good food to dine here. The only thing that I did not care for was the lobster although the risotto was amazing as it is not so fresh in my opinion. However, I would definitely return here.","date":"2018-05-14 23:36:03"}

Got reservations for four people for the soft opening at 7:45 on a Friday night.  Checked in with the friendly hostess a little early so we waited closer to our reservation time to get seated. (Loved the hostess outfits with the small details of their pitchfork pins and necklaces...nice touch).  Got seated at a table and our waitress was Brenda and she asked if we had a time schedule and if we had any food allergies and if it was our first time.  We don't drink while we eat so we ordered two ice teas and it came with agave which was super good and fun.  Our friends got wine.  We started with the wagyu meatballs and lobster risotto (lobster was amazing) for appetizers and for the entrees we ordered filet mignon and the ny strip.  Both steaks were prepared beautifully.  For sides we ordered potato purée and roasted cauliflower (normally I love roasted cauliflower but something was a little off on this one).  On of our friends ordered the salmon and our other friend ordered the pre-fixe menu which came with scallops for the appetizers, beef Wellington for the entree and sticky toffee pudding for desert.  Just wish I could have ate more and ordered the pumpkin soup and dessert :) . The manager came over at the end of the meal to make sure everything was good, and it was!  Everything was amazing and we had a great time.  Thanks to our server, Brenda and the rest of the staff.  Can't wait to come back.","date":"2018-01-20 20:07:36"}

Another restaurant marked off of my bucket list.  The inside decor is reminiscent of the tv show hells kitchen which I'm sure they were going for.  Kitchen is open to the dining room so you can see them preparing your dish.  They have the recognizable red team and blue team in the kitchen.   Place is large and for a friday afternoon was packed. \nEveryone from the hostess to our waiter to the water lady to the manager was really nice.  Always smiling and asking how things were going.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  Extremely helpful in helping us decide what we were going to order. \nFor appetizers we ordered the lobster risotto and HK hotwings.  Came out in about 20 min.  7 small pieces of chicken that were a little spicy with blue cheese sauce.  They were alright, flavored well.  The lobster risotto had a small piece of lobster tail on top.   Lobster was cooked well, not too rubbery.  And the risotto was tomato based, with slightly aldente fluffy rice.  Not bad at all.  The appetizers helped in cutting the pangs of hunger as we waited about 40 min for our main courses.\nFor the main course we ordered the mushroom pizza and gordon ramsey's signature beef wellington.  Pizza was slightly doughy but had about 6 or 8 large slices, and for the price wasen't bad at all.  The beef wellington was cooked medium rare and was just excellent.   Tender, flavorful, cooked to perfection.  The puff pastry perfectly encased the filet mignon.\nThe drinks were good too.  I had their famous meet your maker cocktail and note from ramsey cocktail.   The meet your maker was a little bit more heavy handed in the alcohol.  But both tasted great considering how hot it was on the strip. \nPricing wasen't bad either.  All that plus tip came out to about $190 gofr 3 people.\nOverall no doubt this place is somewhat overrated.  But it was nice to try dishes invented by a world famous chef and made famous by a popular tv show.  I'd definitely come back!!!","date":"2018-07-13 21:49:57"}

The menu features all of the dishes you're used to hearing called out and did not disappoint. \n\nWe had wished the starter portions were larger just so we could enjoy more of them. The beef wellington was fantastic and the sticky toffee pudding was enough for two to enjoy. \n\nIt's a fine dining establishment on the strip and the cost reflects that, but for the flavours and experience, it's one that would be repeated in a heartbeat. \n\nParking Tip: The restaurant is located near the main valet for Caesar's Palace. Valet is $15 but if you don't want to endure the long walk from the parking structure, it's a option worth exploring.","date":"2018-01-20 22:04:55"}

No yelling like the show and no one was tossed out of the kitchen but it was well worth it.  A little pricey but the food was worth every penny.  You really need a reservation to get in.  Next time we want to try the dinner menu because we did go at lunch.  The atmosphere was relaxed, servers were on top of everything, and the food was heavenly.  I did get an autograph with the last Hell's Kitchen winner - Michelle.  That was super cool!  She even took a photo with me.

Carlos our server was the MOST caring and professional server you could ask for on the strip. He was more concerned about our experience rather than just put food on the table. \n\nNow to the experience. We strongly recommend the Beef Welllington experience with the paired wine. While it is a cost conscious choice it truly was an experience all the way to the overwhelming finish of desert. Each wine paired so magnificently with its dish. The Beef Wellington is all the hype lives up for.\n\nIf you make it to desert the port paired with the carmelized bread pudding puts you over the top and I ask isn't that why you came to Vegas, then Hell's Kitchen? \n\n\nHands down best experience we have had in our life and while the food was exquisite, that can be ruined by the service which was definitely willing to go above and beyond the call of duty.

My wife and I were pretty excited to go to Hell's Kitchen at Caesar's today. When we arrived, we were promptly greeted with very friendly staff congratulating us on our recent anniversary. It was nice to see they paid attention to the notes on the OpenTable reservation. We were sat immediately with a nice table by a window with a direct view of the strip. The waitress was very nice and helpful and there was plenty of staff catering to our every request. After seeing the famous lobster risotto on the menu, I demanded to my wife we must order it. The resulting risotto was disappointing, while the presentation was good, the flavor was simply bland and uninspired. I would have expected something so delicious I would have wanted it for the entire meal, I was barely motivated to finish it as an appetizer. The Wagyu meatballs were about as bland and boring. The Salmon was ok, nothing to write home about. On the other hand, the Avocado Toast was amazing. Completely different from anything I had before. After eating I found myself wanting more. Considering we paid in total $150 for a lunch where the only thing exceptional to eat was avocado toast, I found Hell's Kitchen not to be worth it. I hate saying this because the staff was really amazing however when you make a trip to Hell's Kitchen, your expectations are to have really great food. This was simply not the case.","date":"2018-04-22 21:56:29"}

Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, Ramsay and what fans of his would be interested in, etc. and made recommendations without taking up too much time or being pushy.\n\nI had the rack of lamb and the potato gratin side and both were very good. The spinach that accompanied it was also tasty and not over cooked which I think is typical at many restaurants. My friend got the prix fixe menu (scallops, beef Wellington, sticky toffee pudding). I am so happy she shared her first course with me because it was perfect, but also our main dishes took FOREVER to come out. \n\nOur server (I think his name was Greg) and the manager were very apologetic and provided updates about our food and tried to make it right. I think our ticket may have gotten \"lost\" because we saw a few tables seated after us get their food before us and leave before we even got our food. \n\nOur server asked us at the beginning if we had any time constraints and we had said no because it was only shortly after 7pm when we were seated and the show we had tickets for only a mile down the strip didn't start until 9:30 (we barely made it). I felt bad for the people who accompanied us at our table because they only ordered a salad and macaroni and cheese and it took a FULL HOUR for it all to arrive. (It's also an open kitchen so which is very entertaining if you're fans of the show.)\n\nBecause the wait was so long, our server checked again about whether we had to be anywhere which was appreciated and our food was boxed up and our checks brought to us very quickly.

She asked us if we had plans after dinner that we needed to leave in time for and she was very attentive to my gluten and dairy allergies. Everyone else that we came into contact with at the restaurant was on the same level. Our drinks were never less than half full. \n\n2 stars for the execution of the service. This is not a knock on the politeness of our waitress or the other staff. Like I previously stated, the staff was great. However, the execution of some of the idea was not great. I ordered all of my dishes without dairy, while the staff was very attentive to this, my appetizer came with a dairy puree that I specifically took off. Of course they replaced it right away, but it was still inconvenient. One server set entrees down on our table that were pretty close to what we ordered but realized it wasn't for us and took them away and placed them on the table next to us.

Honestly it is so rich, and they give you such a big serving, that two people can split one order of that desert. \n\nThis place books up fast! So if you are coming to Vegas, plan ahead.

You have to wait in a long line to let them know you arrived, then you are just sent out anywhere. Literally.

Then as your time draws closer, you go back and wait in another line for them to call you. The staff is patient.

EVERYTHING but the braised short rib we would have ordered again that night....it was just superb! The short rib sadly was dry and we found everything else so top notch that it definitely stood out as the night's one and only dud. \n\nAs an early season fan (sorry, haven't watched in years), it was so cool to feel like I was in the HK restaurant and to finally, FINALLY be able to taste Gordon's beef wellington and lobster risotto. The sticky toffee pudding was a perfect way to end a cold winter Las Vegas dinner! I loved it - it reminded me of a date cake with caramel sauce, so good! \n\nThe let down for us as a dinner table was the lack of service from our server and for paying $27\/glass per wine - having it spilt on the table and not wiped up. The table itself also wobbled and we found ourselves on numerous occasions having to grab our glasses if we moved or touched it. In addition, it went from our server pushing our dishes through hurriedly to completely absent at the end of the night. The gentleman who was refilling our water glasses should have been our server as he was extremely upbeat, helpful and polite.  \n\nAll in all, this was a fabulous dinner but service & facilities could have been better after we \"meditated\" on our $250 dinner tab; which is why there was only a 18% gratuity given and not 20%+ and why this review is 4 stars and not 5. \n\nUltimately, will I be back to try again? Absolutely, 100% YES! Just I won't be purchasing wine and I will stick to bottled water.","date":"2018-03-10 23:18:55"}

It was worth the drive and it was worth every penny spent. \n\nAlex was our server and he was attentive, professional and had the qualities of a server you would want.

I was not shy. I had 3 cocktails, lobster risotto for appetizer, and the three course meal that definitely had me more than satisfied when I was done. Everything came out tasting good. The only one gripe I might have to say about the food is the food was borderline on the cold side. It was lukewarm and not piping hot or close to for that great warm expected and 'needed' for cooked food. \n\nAll I'm saying is if you're a fan go..... if you're not a fan, or care for it, I'm guessing after this you might be.","date":"2018-01-29 02:09:39"}

Hell's Kitchen is definitely not just hype. Loved every bite of food.  It was a goal to try as many things as we could to make a fair assessment.  I started with a fruit drink that contained ginger beer, and other additions.  Such a unique taste that I now crave that taste.  A golden beet salad for my wife.  She said it beat every beet salad to date.  I had the red quinoa salad for me.  Again it added to the total meal. Also had the prawns that they flame at the table. Video moment. Then Beef Wellington for my wife.  I also tried it and we both agreed it was beyond belief. Tender, tasty, mushroom infused puff pastry covered prime cut of beef! NY cut steak was so tasty and flavorful cooked beautifully.  Potato puree and cheesy mac just kept adding to the experience. Had to end with a dessert that is not on the menu.  It was shaved pineapple with sorbet and passion fruit foam.  It was the perfecting ending.  Of course coffee was all that.  After photos of the exciting interior and open kitchen.  Meeting the Executive Chef topped it all off.  At least this night, it was a home run.  And not to forget Casey out waiter. Such an asset to Hell's kitchen. Casey explained every item with knowledge of each.  Not pushy, right there when you needed him, as good as a waiter can be. Also thanks to each staff member.

We had reservations for Sunday lunch as this was a busy weekend and we couldn't get in at night. This is a hot and new restaurant so we couldn't wait to see what all the buzz was about.\n\nOur server Barbara was excellent. Very attentive. She had a helper and food runners so she was free to attend to her tables. Excellent service from her. \n\nThey were out of the ingredients for the drink my husband ordered so he just had water. \n\nI wanted to try the Wellington but we've eaten so much steak over the weekend and we were getting ready to fly out so we opted for lighter fare. Based on other reviews, I see now this was a big mistake. The burgers and Wellington have rave reviews. \n\nWe ordered the seafood tower, scallops, and Caesar salad and sticky toffee pudding.\n\nI'm assuming that they use their green romaine for the burgers and all hearts of romaine for Caesar. If you're looking for a green Caesar, this salad is not for you. The Parmesan wedges are lemony perfection.\n\nAfter our salad, we waited and waited and waited. Seafood has such a short Cook time and the clams and oysters are served in the shell so we were surprised it took well over 30 minutes to get our food. When they did bring it out, we were so excited to see it coming but they delivered it to our neighbors table. The manager was so proud to deliver the food and apologized to our neighboring table. They said it wasn't their food and he was very confused. We motioned that it was ours, so he grabbed it from their table and placed it on ours with no apology. With the recent flu outbreak and so much brouhaha over our dish, I was a little grossed out. But we were starving and needed to get to the airport shortly. We didn't have another half hour to wait on fresh and properly cooked seafood.\n\nIt is a beautiful presentation. Handcrafted boat. By the way, the tableware and linens are lovely except for the dishes which remind me of a bathtub that needs reglazing. They seem to be porous which caused me to wonder about sanitation. \n\nThe lobster was over cooked and couldn't be cut with a knife. Very hard to chew.\nThe king crab was over cooked and very mealy. \nThe shrimp were very large and steamed\/boiled perfectly. They were the star of the show. We are from Louisiana via Boston and we KNOW how Seafood is supposed to be served. This dish did not make the mark. Far too expensive to gamble on. \n\nThe scallops were thin and over cooked. The sauce and bacon\/apple accoutrement was excellent but not sufficient to revive the dead scallops.\n\nWe finished with sticky toffee pudding which was the star of the show. Highly recommend. The ice cream to sponge ratio was a little off -needed a wee bit more ice cream but the flavor and texture was remarkable. \n\nThere's so much good food in Las Vegas for less money. You shouldn't have to pay $$$$ for average and over cooked food. \n\nWe're happy to say we tried it and can check it off our list.\n\nUpdate: Hell's Kitchen has reached out to me in response to this review to assure me that they are addressing food quality and service. Their attentiveness is appreciated and duly noted.","date":"2018-01-29 16:11:19"}

We also had wagyu meatballs, Mac and cheese and the peanut butter cheesecake.\n\nScallops - a standard item on the show and featured on the Prix Fixe menu. The bottoms of mine were not seared at all, the tops had a nice crust, and because of the thikness difference, some we're overcooked. They were OK overall, but I have most definitely had better scallops.\n\nWagyu Meatballs - these were honestly the best thing we ordered. They are delicy and I'd eat them again, no problem. Some house bread to eat the sauce with would have made for a better meal than the lamb.\n\nLamb - We ordered the lamb medium well (my girlfriend does not like rare meats) it came very rare - more rare than even I like generally. The text was not great as the fat wasn't rendered and by the time it got to us it wasnt hot so it was mostly unpleasant to eat. 1 of the chops was cooked more, and it tasted ok, but again, nothing really to write home about.\n\nBeef Wellington - Another show feature. The cook on this was better, and it was tender. The puff pastry wasn't very puffy and was soggy in some places, but overall it did taste good.\n\nMac and Cheese - SUPER rich. It tastes delicious but I couldn't eat more than two bites without being overwhelmed by it, so I just packed it up to take home.\n\nToffee Pudding - this was pretty good. The outer portions of the cake that got carmelized in the oven taste fantastic, the center was a bit dense, but overall a very good dessert.\n\nPeanut butter cheesecake - nothing to write home about. It wasn't BAD, but tasted like just about any other cheesecake on the world. \n\nService was also a bit slow. We had a late reservation, and time to get drink or app orders was slow, then something got messed up in the kitchen so time between apps and entrees was VERY long. Our server was nice, and we got one dessert for free as an apology for the errors.\n\nOverall, the food was OK, and it was a neat experience, but I'm unlikely to go back as the food quality is just a bit below what is required for the price.","date":"2018-06-05 23:28:57"}

Cheesy but cute.  Hostesses were fine. Not \"friendly\" but not rude either. They we're just fine. We were a party of 3 and were seated promptly at our reservation time, which was nice. The hostess let us know who should be serving is, but I forgot her name!  The server was sweet and friendly.  The room was sparse. It's a huge space. I think if they fit the proper amount of tables in, the kitchen probably couldn't handle it. Most appetizers are $20+\/-. It is very overpriced for the mediocre food that was served. We ordered the Scampi Prawn Flambe ($24)and Lobster Risotto($24) for appetizers. They had interesting flavors, but the risotto portion was small and undercooked. The prawns had a beautiful presentation, but again, nothing special for the price.  For dinner we ordered braised short rib($34), brick pressed chicken($29), and brussel sprouts ($9). The short rib was not bad. Not the best I've ever had but not the worst. When the server came by to ask how everything was we said it was fine. But the chicken however was so dry!!! I didn't notice until I saw my mother sawing at it to cut it. I asked and she said it was really dry. I looked around for the server again, but didn't see her  when she came back, we told the server about the chicken and asked for more sauce. She brought some au jus. The brussel sprouts we're flavorless except for the pickled peppers that were mixed in. I was my mom's bday. We ordered the cheesecake. It was a long, short, narrow, sliver. It was super dense, but the flavor was ok. You could tell it had been sitting in a cooler with the toppings already on it. It had a candle, but no \"Happy Birthday\" written on it.

I was so excited when I saw that Gordon opened this place up. It was the main thing I looked forward to on this trip. I made my reservations on open table 2 to 3 weeks before our arrival. We were a party of 4. Seating was on time so a good start right? ...no not so much. We were seated in a back area of the restaurant..couldnt see the kichen..red blue teams...the music was loud..customer talking louder so everyone could hear the other..We were put at a round table for 6 people or may be 8 ...this is where things instantly take a very bad turn for me. I say to the hostess that they are wasting a 6 to 8 top when we only need a 4 top..she was saying we would have more room. Okay no problem. We sit and then realize that this table is very wobbly and actually the top turns some... like the table is just thrown together at a park outing. Like maybe it was just thrown in there for additional seating. If you put your arms on the table it rocked.  I showed the bus boy who was the waitresses assistant. He said he would mention it to someone. Our server was Brittany..a very pleasant upbeat young lady. When she came to take our drink order I showed Brittany..she said she would see if it could be fixed. None came to fix it. When Brittany took our food order I was still upset  about the whole table issue. I explained to her that we are not difficult people but this experience started off very badly and I am very disappointed...as I was about to spend 300.00 to 500.00 on dinner for 4...a dinner I added I had looked forward to for several weeks. I explained I felt like I was at a table that was just thrown in for extra seating.  To be fair she did then offer to move us to a four top but the damage was done.  She did say she mentioned the table issue to her manager...who never came over. Dinner was good we has Lobster risotto, which really had no ghee  butter flavor at all, the risotto was very good though. 2 of us had  Beef Wellington,no real seasoning..had Vetter at the Paris Eiffel tower, my husband had the beef short ribs, he felt they were dried out and slightly burnt...he said if Gordon was here they would never had made it out of the kitchen. Our family friend is a vegetarian and it was mentioned upon ordering. She ordered the lobster risotto with no lobster..and the quinoa salad at the server suggestion. We shared desserts. When I got the bill I saw I was charged for 4 lobster risotto...ok?? Charged the same for a risotto that had no lobster..? Seriously??? I asked the server about it so she took it to her manager..who again didn't even bother to come over. He took the risotto off the bill and then made a gesture of good will and comped our dessert and coffee. I didn't want that...it was far too late to fix this whole dining experience. It was a total bomb for me. I WOULD NEVER GO BACK. Dinner for 4 was 320.00 including tip.  I expected so much more from this place. I have dined at the Paris Eiffel tower and had a wonderful dinner and an epic experience...tasteful with quality service from beginning to end. Dining is an experience people...start by turning the music down slightly...this is not a night club. Get a manager that gives a damn about the customers. Fix the freaking table or don't seat it. Maybe there are some things that need to be worked out over time, but there shouldn't be unhappy casualties in the mean time..Not sure why I even gave 2 stars...save your money people..go somewhere that your dining experience will be a happy memory and you will be treated like you actually matter. I'm still so upset and disappointed and it is the day after my experience. I still took care of Brittany after all it wasn't her fault..she should not suffer for bad management with horrible customer service issues. A manager that thinks if they take some money off the bill it will change your whole experience. Listen I didn't need money taken off..money is not an issue. I needed my dining experience to be top of the line..I needed it to be an experience Gordon Ramsey himself would expect..","date":"2018-03-13 13:52:34"}

My water glass remained empty for quite a while and this was all I was drinking, so eventually, I asked my server if I could have more water and she never bothered to fill my glass for the remainder of the time we were there even after asking. These are not issues which should be resolved during the soft opening phase, these are the most basic server responsibilities! I am such a huge fan of hells kitchen and as a local, was very excited about this restaurant, but came away very disappointed in many ways.","date":"2018-01-30 22:35:54"}

With such a big name as Gordon Ramsay you'd have really high expectations for this place. The scallops were cold when given to us and was replaced with another cold scallop appetizer. When asked we were told that they are supposed to come out that way as in room temperature. The server told us that he would take it off our bill from the prix fixe menu, but when the check came he said he couldn't take it off and took a beer off instead. How can you compare a beer to a crappy scallop appetizer? Not only that, but that beef Wellington was definitely sub par. The temperature itself was not hot either when it arrived and the short rib entree was so much better! Finally I had a hot dish the way it's supposed to come. The best dish we ordered had to be the lobster risotto. This was a big disappointment of a meal when your expectations are so high from the beginning.","date":"2018-08-11 23:53:08"}

He likes his meat more cooked than I do so I think it would've preferred it at medium rare. It had amazing flavor and an amazing sear on the outside.

The sticky toffee pudding is hands down the best dessert we've ever had and I doubt it will ever be beaten. \nFor drinks we each had a cocktail. I ordered the Meet Your Maker; it was very tasty if you like drinks a little on the sweeter side. It had more of a strawberry and bourbon taste than any other flavor. My fiancé ordered the Fear & Loathing. Neither of us liked it at all. The server did say it had a little of a smoky flavor, but it tasted (to us) like they used charcoal for ice cubes. Bleh.

All the rest was below our expectations. We made reservation long ago, however had to wait 20 min to be seated. We chose the strip view - which was a definite mistake. Go for kitchen view. Strip view tables are behind some curtain (what was that for??), and there is an actual view only for the parties of 2. We were 3, so didn't get to see anything. When our food arrived (after a while) - it was all cold, below room temperature!! They might be still new, so didn't learn how to get the food hot to the customers. We notified our server, and they did remove all the meals from our check. We appreciate that a lot, however, that wasn't what we came for, we wanted to enjoy special food. I guess the food tasted good, however, it was so cold that we couldn't appreciate the taste. Have you ever tried cold beef wellington??\nAlso, note that the portions are super tiny, so if you have a great appetite, you must open your wallet and order more. \nI would suggest only go there if you are really Gordon Ramsay's fan, and want to see him on that screen.

Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen is one of many of the Gordon Ramsay's food locations on the strip but this one is new and the food was worth dropping a couple of Benjamin's. If you're in Las Vegas, I highly recommend the Pan Seared Scallops and the Wagyu Meatballs as appetizers. Me and my fiancé order two appetizers because well Viva La Vegas people. We both had the Beef Wellington which is recommended to be eaten at Medium Rare temp. I eat my meat medium rare anyway so this was no issue but my fiancé is more of a Well-done man but he decided to try it the way it was meant to be made and he loved it! He especially loved the Demi-glacé. The waiter brought us a small tasting plate from the \"B-Team\" for us to try at no extra cost. The teams compete much like on the show and they don't mind you taking photos in front of them. We were celebrating our anniversary and my birthday so they brought us out the sticky toffee pudding cake dessert that also comes with ice cream and it was so scrumptious. I would definitely come back anytime I'm in Vegas. I do recommend that you reserve your table online or call to reserve. We had the trip planned for weeks and couldn't get a table. But luckily, I kept checking online every day for an opening and one time slot became available. You will not regret spending the money or eating here the food is succulent and pleasurable!

The scallops were cut in half (we were with a culinary friend who was flabbergasted they would do this ). The beef wellington was tender but the crust was soggy, The toffee pudding was excellent. My wife's lobster risotto was dry and very tiny for 24.00. They bill the lobster as being poached in butter, it was not. \nBut the most surprising disappointment is that this is your average restaurant.

We actually tried emailing and contacting the network to be guest on the show since we live in LA but after numerous, i mean...numerous.. attempts we stopped trying since we never got a response or know anyone from the network. ;( which is why when they had this restaurant opening (which we found out from the last ALL STAR season) we were beyond EXCITED!! Here is my quick break down. \n\nAtmosphere: They have a red\/blue team set up in an open kitchen just like the show which we loved! Unfortunately we sat near the window so we were far from the open kitchen. The overall atmosphere is pretty casual since we're dining on the strip. The overall vibe isn't too bad. It's not a whisper to your company quiet or scream b\/c its so loud restaurant. Overall I think the overall atmosphere and lighting of the restaurant is 4 stars. I just wished all guest were able to view the open kitchen. \n\nService: Our service overall was good. Our server was really nice but she was kind of too fast for us..if that makes sense. My only very very minor complaint would be that she tried to push ordering sides in which we didn't want any sides. We told her we didn't want sides but she ended up saying that the Mac and cheese was really good; we should try it.. we said no thank you. There may have been a miscommunication b\/c after she repeated our order she said mac and cheese?!?! So we had to tell her three times no thank you. I don't like being rude or annoying customers b\/c I've waited tables before but she made me really confused and kind of \"wth\" mode. I understand that they probably have to try to sell the extras to the customers but no means no lady! haha anyway all seriousness, we still gave her a generous tip and overall she was attentive. 4 stars \n\nFood: I ordered their pre-fix menu which I chose the seared scallops, beef wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding. My boyfriend got the lobster risotto for app and filet mignon. We shared my dessert, thank goodness we did b\/c the dessert was definitely enough for two! \n\nThe seared scallops were delicious. The sear for most of the scallops were spot on. The sauce and center slaw that came with it was tasty as well. My only complaint was that I wanted more scallops!\n\nThe lobster risotto fell short for us. Maybe because it was squash base but it was a TAD bland for us. Maybe they needed to add a little more butter or salt but something was off. The lobster was delicious and not rubbery like some other places. After seeing it on the show, we probably over hyped it in our heads. \n\nBeef Wellington: The infamous beef wellington.. was absolutely perfect. The only thing about the wellington is that, its kind of difficult to eat in the sense that the pastry would fall off the steak. Flavor wise, cook wise, and portion wise it was 5 stars. We actually had the beef wellington previously from Gordan ramsays other restaurant Steak at Paris Hotel and this one doesn't compare! I know it's the same chef..but the one we had at the hells kitchen was better. \n\nFilet Mignon: The portion def looks larger on TV than the one we got in person. Flavor wise it was spot on. I've had other filets at numerous restaurants and the one here is delicious. Comes with some roasted tomatoes and Bearnaise sauce. The sauce was good with the filet but for me, a perfectly cooked\/seasoned filet needs NO SAUCE! end of story. I would want to try the NY strip next time I'm here. \n\nToffee sticky pudding: WINNER of the night. All the other reviews did not disappoint. We were pretty full already from dinner but when the dessert came out.. we just couldn't help ourselves. Spoon after spoon of foodgasmic heaven. I don't know what it is..maybe it's the toffee but OMG. MUST TRY! It's not overly powerfully sweet, the ice cream on top does the perfect touch. The pudding itself is so moist but not to the point of no texture either. My mouth is watering as I type.. 5\/5!! \n\nOne of our biggest disappointments is that we did not see the season winner Michelle as executive chef!!! Then I found out on IG that she didn't start yet.. we will go back just to see her! \n\nOverall I feel like there are a few things that can be fixed but it's still a fairly new restaurant. I advise making a reservation. We got super lucky with a last minute one. I would come back and try the other items and support Gordan Ramsay!","date":"2018-03-02 22:52:59"}

It was our last day (few hours before heading to the airport to fly out after spending Labor Day weekend in Vegas), and we decided Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen would be a good spot for lunch.  Menu looked good, and we figured casual 'bar food' would be good enough.\n\nWe arrived just before a big rush of patrons (we were immediately seated at 11:30am but had we waited any longer we would have been in a long line of people waiting for a table).   I've watched the Gordon Ramsay TV show, but didn't expect much of the restaurant. I was very mistaken.  It's in a prime spot in front of Caesar's palace.   The restaurant decor is much more upscale than I anticipated from the outside, and the servers are really above and beyond -- making sure they give very detailed descriptions (moreso than just what the menu states) of the food.   Our server was super helpful in us decide which items to try out our first time at the restaurant (the menu is full of great choices).\n\nWe went with the Wagyu Meatballs for an appetizer -- highly recommended.   I had the Short-Rib Grilled Cheese for lunch, while my wife had the Hell's Kitchen Burger.    She gave me a few bites of her burger and -- WOW! -- definitely in the Top 5 of tastiest gourmet-level burgers.  The spice and heat from the Hell's Kitchen Burger sneaks up on you...in a good way!   I loved my Short-Rib Grilled Cheese, but quite honestly regretted not going for the burger.   C'est la vie!  Next time for sure.\n\nWe wrapped up lunch with the sticky toffee pudding dessert.  Very good -- though, I have to say I also ate at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill earlier that week and their version of sticky toffee pudding was much better (sorry GRHK).   That being said, there's really no such thing as a 'bad' sticky toffee pudding.  No complaints!\n\nWe were both totally impressed with Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen and plan on returning next trip to Vegas.   I would definitely recommend making a reservation, though.

The girl said ok we will seat you closer to your reservation, thats it not another word. \nSo we wait and I am observing what it going on. I see people going up to them then i see most being ushered over to a line where there is a red rope. So I am assuming maybe these people don't have reservations. Then I see them starting to be seated. Ok now I am confused and now it is 2:35 and my reservation was at 2:30. I move closer to hear what people are being told. I hear a woman go up and also say she had a reservation the girl tells her to stand in the line. Now i am really confused so I go up and ask about our table and she picks up a paper and says I have you next. I said ok am I supposed to be standing in that line or what am I supposed to be doing, waiting for my name to be called as it is now close to 15 min after my reservation, right then the girl who seats people comes up and asks if I am Shirley to which I reply yes, she then proceeds to take us to our table, super nice girl and I ask her how does this reservation\/walking thing work and what is the line? She explains to me that the girl was supposed to take my name and have me stand in that line. I told her that perhaps they need to tell the girls to be more specific so people aren't walking around or sitting there confused as I was. She was very nice and apologetic. So that part ended there as I didn't want that to ruin my experience:) \n\nNow we sit down, within second waiter is there and we had awesome service! \nThe whole atmosphere was exceptional. \nWe had the following dishes: \n\n1) Grilled chicken sandwich\n2) Hells Kitchen Burger\n3) And I of course had the 3 course Beef Wellington meal and it was the best cut of meat I have ever had! Melts in your mouth and cooked to perfection. Perfect portion of starch and vegetables to go along with it! \nThe chorizo pumpkin soup another dish I am just speechless about. The crunch of the few pieces of chorizo in the soup give it the perfect kick of spice! \nThe toffee steamed pudding type dessert with this mocha flavored ice cream is just to die for! I highly recommend that you try this $60 three course meal if you go there, it would be crazy to go and not have the beef wellington!! Oh and it is $90 if you choose the wine pairing option:) \nI did have one glass of riesling which was also better than average, perfect sweetness, perfectly chilled and no bitter after taste! Highly recommend!!\n\n4) Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail! A must have...fresh jumbo shrimp full of flavor as it is tossed in a spicy type seasoning and accompanied by a very flavorful cocktail Sauce!! \n\nThe burger and chicken sandwiches consumed by others in my party I am told were very good! They also raved about the sauces which accompanied each sandwich! \n\nAll in all what a great experience, I cannot wait to get back to Vegas and go again! By far the best meal I have had in Vegas!!!! And saved me lots of money away from gambling\n\nValue: \n4 people\n$165\n\nOnly reason for 4 stars is that experience with the hostess and seating.

Service was impeccable! Megan and her team were attentive and friendly. Beauty and Essex has some of the best service. But Megan and her HK team beat them hands down. The food was nothing short of amazing. EVERY item was superb! Appetizers - Caesars Salad, Waygu Meatballs, Pumpkin Soup, Scallops and Lobster Risotto were extremely tasty!  Beef Wellington, Filet Mignon, NY Steak, Beef Short Rib were phenomenal! If you have never eaten Wellington, its a must try. My son forced me to try it. It was so flavorful. Mac M Cheese side was the best mac n cheese ever eaten. Smooth, creamy and cheese with so much flavor. Desserts were just as good. NOTHING beats Sticky Toffee Pudding!!! But the Pineapple Passion dessert gives it a run. Its so light, refreshing and unexpectedly full of different flavors and not overly sweet!  It was a perfect way to end my meal. The 4 others had our normal Toffee Pudding. This place has a great vibe, very electric and loud. The ambiance is perfect. We sat next to the large windows overlooking the strip. \nThanks again to Megan and her team for unbelievable service. \nPlease try the Wellington and End with the Pineapple Passion dessert. You wont regret it.","date":"2018-01-15 23:10:04"}

It's all about the spectacle, but I guess that makes sense given the show it was based on. One thing to note before going: this place is LOUD. I could barely hear the person next to me.

We started out with lobster risotto, wagyu meatballs, scallops. The lobster risotto was tasty but it was a little Bland, no salt no pepper and there is no salt and pepper on the table, they had changed it from I think it was butternut squash just something else that tasted a lot like Parmesan cheese. It was good but it needed some seasoning. The wagyu meatballs were delicious the polenta croutons were a nice addition to the gooey cheese and tasty marinara. It tasted like it was mixed with Italian sausage and had fried basil on the top. The scallops to me were not good, they tasted Raw and had a weird texture. Maybe I'm just not a scallop eater but my friend that I was with said they were very good and she finished the rest. I would say out of all three of our appetizers the meatballs were the best to me. Moving on to our entrees I ordered the short rib with polenta and baby vegetables and my friend ordered the highly-anticipated Beef Wellington. The short rib just fell apart! It was delicious the baby vegetables we're just tender enough but still had a little bit of crunch there were carrots tomatoes and I think that they were baby turnips. But again were delicious. Unto the Beef Wellington, it was outstanding! The demi-glace on it was rich the baby vegetables were delicious and the red potatoes were light and creamy. We also shared two sides we ordered the chili lime roasted cauliflower and the potatoes au gratin we both did not care for the cauliflower but as soon as we put some seasoning on the potatoes augratin they were perfect. For as much food as we ordered the bill wasn't as high as I thought it would be without tip it was under 200 and my friend had a glass of wine and I just had water and a soft drink. You may not go everyday but I suggest going at least once if you're in Las Vegas it was very good.","date":"2018-08-31 17:19:44"}

Of course we threw on a Kettle One Dirty Martini to keep the fun going.\n\nThe meal was great, and filling.

Obviously, the restaurant was made for the fans of the show. My wife being a fan wanted to try the foods that the chefs on the show are demanded to make.\nThe exterior, just like the show, you are welcomed by a huge HK and pitchfork (photo op). Once you enter you are then greeted by a whole bunch HK merch and video playback of Chef Ramsay welcoming you to the restaurant. \nSo far I feel like I'm waiting in line for theme park restaurant for mediocre food. Because the whole atmosphere is geared to seek the pleasure of the audience and begging for their attention - look at me or buy me and a group of hostesses looking pretty, but not too friendly like the cashiers at The Varsity (a fast food place in Atlanta, Ga famous for their unfriendly service).\n\nHowever, after being seated we were impressed. The interior was pretty grand. Low lighting in the dining area and spotlight on display of the open kitchen, as if you were there for a show. The chefs were already assigned to their groups, either red or blue. It wasn't a competition - they were just cooking. You can also observe the executive chef keeping quality control over whatever dishes came out. And along the side of the kitchen counter, there were servers lined up to carry out approved dishes to their customers.   \n\nThat night my wife and I had the pleasure of ordering, HK signature prix fixe menu ($69) and an entree roasted rack of lamb ($39). \nThe prix fixe menu consists of three courses. \nFirst - choice of pan seared scallops or caesar salad \nSecond (main course) - beef wellington\nThird (dessert) - sticky toffee pudding\n\nDinner, food - finally! Wow is what I'd like to say. I believe the hype now and why Chef Ramsay makes such a big deal over his foods. I mean we already knew how seriously he took his foods when we had the pleasure of dining at his 3 Michelin Star restaurant in London (Restaurant Gordon Ramsay) and watching his shows, however, I didn't expect it for a show\/ commercial kitchen. \n\nScallops seared and seasoned perfectly. Yes, the scallops were not sent back for being raw!\n\nThe beef wellington perfect medium rare with the flaky outer crust. The first bite melts in your mouth with the sensational collage of taste of truffles and mustard. \n\nThe rack of lamb, also perfect medium rare with the savory taste from the lamb jus. And if you're afraid of trying lamb because of the gamey taste ... fear not. This lamb does not taste like so. \n\nFinally, the dessert - the sticky toffee pudding. Damn ... this was it. I feel like cursing because it was that good. My wife and I aren't dessert people. We don't really eat sweets but for the sake of the dining experience, we do from time to time. But man! This toffee pudding was damn good. One bite we had to sit back and take in what we just ate. \n\nIf I were to describe the taste I would say it is the perfect blend of sweet and savory in a spongy smooth blend of bread and toffee. The dessert was warm and moist to the last bite. \n\nThroughout the night my cousin who works at the Caesar Palace restaurants (Director of Wine ... don't know the official title) greeted us and brought us a bottle of champagne and briefly talked and ran to a meeting. \n\nOverall, dinner experience - spectacular. \n\nWe would definitely come back when we are back in Vegas.","date":"2018-02-28 15:01:24"}

The staff was very nice our waiter was great. The food was good but for the price point it wasn't fantastic. I really expected it to be better. I had the short rib, I had short rib at North Italia in Summerlin the week before and it was so much better. The short rib I had at Hell's Kitchen had some pieces that were a little tough like it had dried out a bit. Everyone was thought their food was good but not excellent and we all eat in great restaurants often. The worst part of the evening was when my boyfriend's uncles glass broke and got water all over him when we first sat down. It was his water glass and it must have still been hot from the dishwasher, the waiter poured ice water into and and a few seconds after when he picked it up the bottom of the glass just fell off resulting in water going all over him. The manager came over, he didn't make a huge deal out of it but was visibly embarrassed. She comped him one drink... I thought she could have done a bit more than that, being that it started out our evening on a bad note and it was clearly no fault of his. Will not be returning. There are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas, this one is not worth repeating.","date":"2018-09-22 20:03:48"}

The food to be honest didn't blow us away as much as when we ate at Gordon Ramsay Steak, but I thought our beef Wellington was better at this location.

Unfortunately, the food and service at Hells Kitchen were extremely underwhelming. \n\nWhen we checked in for our reservation, we were then asked to wait in line. We were sat at a table by the kitchen which was nice. Based on our table location, we were being served food from the blue kitchen. We were then greeted by our waitress who asked if we have dined here before. I advised we had not but have eaten at his steakhouse. She passed out the menus and left the table. She did not go over any of the signature drinks or even take our drink order. She came back about 10 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order. She did not ask if we have any question or make any recommendations on the menu. We placed our order for drinks at the same time as the food. When we told her our drink order with the food order she forget what we order and ask us what we would like to drink again. We ordered ginger ale, root beer, Jack Daniels on the rocks and a Stella. All 4 drinks were brought to our table separately which was odd, as typically all drinks would be brought together. We also had to ask the waitress for the Jack Daniels twice as she forgot it. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered prawns flambé, shrimp cocktail and meatballs. They brought out the flambé and shrimp cocktail but no meatballs. Having previously dined at the Steakhouse and having watched Hell's Kitchen, all food should be served at the same time. This was not the case and a theme throughout our dining experience. We had finished the 2 appetizers that were brought out and were still waiting for the waitress to come back so we could ask for the meatballs. When she finally came over to the table and we inquired about the missing appetizer, she went over to the order kiosk and it looked like she was adding it to the order. She then proceeded to go to the chef at the pass and tell him the issue. A server from the red kitchen had just got meatballs to walk to a table and was stopped to bring them to ours instead. The flambé and shrimp cocktail were good and the meatballs were decent (not enough sauce). \n\nFor our entrees we ordered 2 Beef Wellington's, rack of lamb, filet mignon, mushrooms and French fries. Given where we were seated we could see our food sitting at the pass for a while. It looks like they were waiting for garnish to get our side dishes ready. When the food arrived everything was there except the French Fries and we had to ask for them as they were forgotten. The food was luke warm at best since it was sitting at the pass for so long. While the food was edible, it is not even comparable to the Beef Wellington served at Gordon's Steakhouse, which I ate 2 out of the 3 times dining at his Steakhouse. The Beef Wellington was packed with too much mushroom so it made the puff pastry fall apart when you cut into it. The potato purée was thick and the sauce was not good either. \n\nFor dessert we ordered Sticky Toffee Pudding and the cheesecake. The Sticky Toffee Pudding tasted good but the texture was off. Given that it is cake made out of dates, the texture more grainy than the 3 times I ate it at his steakhouse. The cheesecake was decent. \n\nWhile some issues presented above could seem nit picky, if you have dined at one of Gordon's other restaurants and have received exceptional service and consistently wonderful food, this restaurant is definitely a let down. If you are looking to try Gordon's signature dishes (Beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding), I would highly recommend trying his steakhouse at the Paris. The service and food have been spectacular all 3 times.","date":"2018-02-10 21:11:19"}

I felt a bit of a poser going in because the restaurant is obviously influenced by the TV show, which I've never watched in my life.  I obviously know who Gordon Ramsey is and have watched some of his cooking videos, but I wasn't the huge fan of the show that a lot of people in the restaurant were.  When you walk in, you're greeted by a large HK sculpture with the appropriate flames emblazoning the sign, a virtual life-size Gordon Ramsey speaking to you, and a wall of all the Hell's Kitchen past winners.  I guess the prize for the most recent show was not only a cash prize, but also a 1 year contract as head chef at Hell's Kitchen.  There were so many people taking pictures with the kitchen (a replica of the TV show I assume) and the head chef, Michelle.  The restaurant is appropriately hell-themed, with pitchfork designs and flames everywhere you turn.\n\nMy sister and I ordered the 3 course lunch meal which includes an appetizer, meal, and dessert all for $60!  We started with the pumpkin soup, Caesar's salad, and lobster risotto.  The pumpkin soup was unique, in that the waitress brought out an empty bowl with the chorizo, pumpkin seeds, and other additions present on the bottom, and poured the soup into the bowl after she placed it in front of me.  The chorizo bits were small but SO juicy and flavorful.  The lobster risotto was actually my least favorite dish.  Maybe I don't love seafood enough to appreciate lobster, but I felt that the rice in the risotto was a bit undercooked.\n\nFor the main meals, my sister and I got the beef wellington, my mom got the short rib grilled cheese, and my dad got the crispy skin salmon.  The beef wellington completely met my expectations!  It's a very aesthetic dish, but also very difficult to cut.  If you don't know, beef wellington is a cut of filet mignon wrapped with prosciutto, mushrooms, and a puff pastry.  The beef was SO tender and all it's layers paired nicely with the vinegarette\/ wine reduction and mashed potatoes.  The crispy skin salmon was also a great option with the salmon being so perfectly tender and balanced with a nice crunch from the skin.  The short rib grilled cheese was pretty greasy and not a favorite due to the horseradish that was inside.\n\nAs for dessert, my sister and I got the sticky toffee pudding, which was my absolute FAVORITE part of the meal.  It was a sweet toffee drizzled moist, warm bread topped with cookie butter ice cream.  I thought I was pretty hungry after my fine dining experience, but the dessert put me at just the right amount of full.  The waiter highly recommended the Pineapple Carpaccio so our parents ordered that.  It's really attractive because of the show that is presented with the dessert.  The thinly sliced pineapple with passionfruit foam is placed on a glass plate that surrounds dry ice.  The waiter brings out the dish and pours in liquid nitrogen into the dry ice so that you get a smoky show right at your table.  The dessert was pretty simple, but the pineapple with the sour passionfruit foam paired really nicely.\n\nI recommend Hell's Kitchen for a nice meal in Vegas.  Since it opened recently, it's pretty difficult to book reservations, so make sure to book in advance!","date":"2018-04-13 03:29:23"}

We ordered a set and something else for lunch(would've like to come here for dinner but it's all booked)\n\nAnyway, we had lobster risotto and salad for appetizer. The lobster risotto was great! Portion is kinda on the small side but the lobster was cooked well and rice very flavorful. Caesar salad is good, but nothing special(well it's a Caesar salad duh) and could probably use just a little less dressing.\n\nI had the short rib grilled cheese which is pretty good! It came with potato chips which oddly has a lot of burnt\/crumbles that was very oily and made up about 2\/3 of the cup, had to send that back because they were just not good. I asked the waitress if that's how it's suppose to be and she said no it should be mostly the big nice looking chips so she send it back and offered if we want to change it to fries instead which we did. The grilled cheese also came with some pickled vegetables which is a nice tough, very refreshing since grilled cheese and the pulled short rib could be kinda heavy.\n\nThe beef Wellington that's part of the lunch set was great. It's kinda small but good size since we ordered appetizers and there's going to be dessert later. Mash potatoes is nice decoration but kinda blended.\n\nThe dessert is this toffee pudding(I think) with buttermilk ice cream on top. I have to say it looks horrible lol but taste really good. Kinda on the sweet side and very buttery. And oddly this is the only thing that's huge from what we ordered throughout the whole lunch. I doubt anybody that had a full meal can finish this dessert by him\/herself alone! It is really good though.\n\nDidn't order alcohol since we already had a lot earlier. We had the ice tea which is just pretty average. \n\nService overall is nice. The only thing that was kinda strange is that the server which is not he waitress that was taking care of us packed the left over for me. And he somehow left half of the dish somewhere and didn't packed it in the box?! And it's not like we have about two bites left and pack it. I have more than 1\/2 of the sandwich plus most of the fries and pickles. Our waitress basically had to have the kitchen make something to put in the box. \n\nThe dining room is actually beautiful. It's very tourisy with the gift shop look at the front. But that's also what makes this fun cuz they have the red kitchen and blue kitchen going on. Would come again for sure. Make sure you book it early! :)","date":"2018-04-12 07:34:56"}

I finally got a dinner reservation here this past week (granted we booked it a month in advance). \n\nWhen we arrived, we were lead through the busy dining area to a small table in the back of the restaurant in the overflow area. From our view, we didn't have the iconic Hells Kitchen open kitchen view, but we did have a nice view of the Vegas Strip. \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers to start, the Shrimp Flambe, Foie Gras, Scallops, and Lobster Risotto. The Shrimp Flambe was presented with a nice flame broiled effect, but did only come with 3 pieces of shrimp. The Lobster Risotto and Scallops were good, but on the smaller side. The best of these was the Foie Gras, which had a super tasty umami flavor and had a perfect cook on it. If you are hungry or on more of a budget, go for the Macaroni and Cheese since it's by far the most filling and still is yummy. \nNothing about the veggies were phenomenal. I tried the potato gratin, the cauliflower, and the brussel sprouts (which were my favorite). \n\nMy favorite entree was by far the Lamb!! It came with a good sized portion and had the rich lamb savory lamb flavor that I love. The salmon had a good pan sear on it, but I wish it was packed with more seasoning or flavor. I also tried the Beef Wellington, and it was the first time ever having it before so I really couldn't compare it to any others.\n\nThe star of the night was by far the Sticky Toffee Pudding!! You need to try this if you come for anything at all. The cake was so moist, packed with a rich caramel flavor but not too sweet, and a salty caramel ice cream. I devoured it so quickly, and I was tempted to buy another. Yum! I'm still dreaming about it. We also had the pineapple carpaccio, which comes in \n\nThis place is a tourist attraction, and you pay for the Gordon Ramsey name and the fame behind HK. Overall, for the priciness of the meal, I would have liked a more intimate setting and an overall more outstanding food experience. I probably would not go back for dinner, but I would definitely like to try lunch since I've heard great things about the burger!","date":"2018-04-14 21:32:35"}

If you go in there, make sure to ask for John F and Gil. They are a team of servers that gave me some of the best service I've ever experienced.

Open kitchen, yelling in the kitchen perhaps (didn't happen) and all my favorite items that I've been checking out on the show for years (season 1 fan till now) but I guess the reality didn't quite match up to my expectations.  We went there for lunch service and I walked into an entrance that features all the hell's kitchen winners. Even with a reservation we waited in a line with people who had reservations and walk ins but there were enough tables so not a big deal.  The actual restaurant itself was well decorated but isn't very intimate as you can hear what is being said all around you.  The kitchen was broken up into the red and blue but you could see that they were all collectively working on tickets.  It would have been nice to see some of the winners there helping the restaurant and as a fan of the show it would have made the experience so much more exciting.  Not a lot of the times that are featured were available for the lunch crowd but at least I got my lobster risotto.  \n\nThe risotto was delicious but I think the portion compared to what I was expecting from the show was rather small.  I wish I could have ordered that as my main and I would have loved it.  The appetizer oysters were also really good and the melt in your mouth kind of oysters.  They were raw so not much prep required but you could tell that they were of good quality.  They were out of Gordon's drink with a personal note so that was a fail for me.  When you open and are new how do you run out of an item that is featured.  The mains were ok ...my chicken as you can see was rather dry and there wasn't a lot of flavor or moisture.  I couldn't even finish it because it was dry and chewy ...I even tried using the delicious mashed potato side to try and make it tolerable but that didn't work.  \n\nThe overall experience while fun because I'm such a huge fan will not be repeated because at the end of the day the food wasn't what I expected from a signature type of restaurant.","date":"2018-04-14 19:29:19"}

Dry aged steak was fantastic, and the beef Wellington was cooked to perfection. The hostess service was good and efficient. \n\nThe bad - our server was low energy, he clearly wanted to take the order as fast as possible. He then proceeded to stop by once once during the entire dinner service to ask if the food was good.

From our initial 8:45 PM reservation, we got seated at 9 because there were no tables available. The hostess walked us through the entire dining area to find a table but the empty tables were yet to be bussed.

The only downside was that the music was uncomfortably loud mixed with other diners' conversations. I could not hear half the things he was saying... I just kind of nodded to everything. \n\nNow onto the food! \nThe crispy skin salmon- I was speechless. I mean I cannot compare it to anything else but it was just wonderful.\n\nThe brick pressed chicken- The sweet potato hash complimented the chicken so well.

Completely blown away.\n\nWent on a business trip (expenses paid) so picked some decent places to eat. The others were $$-$$$ as well and this was hands down most worth. \n\nFirstly, you must reserve; reservations were all seated very punctually. Ours was at 9:45 came here earlier hoping to get a earlier spot but it was packed but we were fine. We noticed people were getting called in at exactly 9:30, 9:15... and we got called on the dot. Which is very professional and amazing because restaurants usually don't care. Another thing was that when they say this place closes at 10, they stop accepting people at 10.\n\nThe staff was also very friendly for dealing with the heavy customer load they were getting, immediately noticed this because I always see rbf on the servers, but I saw none!\n\nGot seated and our waitress was so nice. Ordered a mocktail, it was okay.\n\nFood ordered:\n\n- lobster tail risotto: I can never be happy with risotto anymore... literally teared... because it was so unbelievably good. I never thought a food item would make me feel that way. I love risotto and I always order it at any restaurant, so I wasn't expecting this. The consistency was perfect. There was still the classic risotto taste, and the taste blended so well with the lobster tail... the portion was perfect. I ate it all... by myself.\n\n- crispy skin salmon: the skin was crispy as it says and the inside was very soft and almost melts in your mouth. Definitely the best salmon I've ever had, not oily. I couldn't understand how they pulled it off.\n\n- lamb rack: like the others very amazing; my friend ordered this so I only had a bite but it was also soft and skillfully cooked.\n\n- bread pudding: good balance between sweet and not too sweet, wasn't too hard or mushy, came with a coffee ice cream. Had the cornbread kind of texture... couldn't finish it but ate all the ice cream. Tried to finish it and wish I didn't. Never say this because I'm thrifty but wish it was smaller size. :,|\n\nRisotto was highlight of my week.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was the tip recommendations; all the other $$$ places I went to had tip recommendations: 18, 20, 22% but they only had 15, 18, 20% here. Modest.\n\nBoth the service and the food were worth 5 stars. It is so hard to find a place that excels at both food and service, service is usually a huge mood kill.\n\nWill definitely be coming back. However my total for  appetizer, drink, entree and desert + tip was $93, but very worth. Expect I would recommend splitting dessert.\n\nTLDR;\n- reservations are punctual on the dot\n- all the workers were respectful and nice (no rbf!)\n- if you enjoy risotto, prepare to be blown away with lobster risotto appetizer \n- portions to quality ratio was good for price.\n- split the dessert (2 people).","date":"2018-03-12 08:15:46"}

My husband make a reservation 2 weeks ago, and we looked forward to it. Hostess was great, and waiter was awesome. We ordered the Meatball appetizer to start, and it wasn't seasoned right. It was tasteless and too cheesy. Hubby ordered Hells Kitchen Burger and I ordered Margherita pizza. The pizza was awful, liquidy when I picked up a slice.

We initially were told they were only seating reservations only; however, we luckily scored a table for four in the bar area within 15minutes.\n\nFood:\n\nAppetizers:\n-Pan seared scallops-perfectly seasoned and was our favorite! Left us wanting more J\n-Lobster risotto-small in portion but it does fall under appetizers so understandable; taste delicious and creamy with the risotto cooked just right-not too soggy or to al dente.\n-Caesar salad-not overdressed and the garlic croutons with crispy parmesan bite added a nice crunch.\n-Baked macaroni & cheese-Depending on how much you order I would say this side can be pretty filling. The crispy prosciutto sprinkled on top added so much flavor :P\n\nEntrees\n-Beef wellington-most popular entrée recommended by the waitress. The filet was cooked perfectly medium rare and super tender! The potato puree was well seasoned but I would say this was a 2nd favorite from our entrees.\n-Prime dry aged ny strip-Medium rare and was melt in your mouth deliciousness! Favorite from the entrees and the red wine glaze sauce complimented the steak well.\n-Roasted rack of lamb-We were feeling meaty as you can tell from our orders but this entrée was not out of the ordinary amazing but was still tasty. I did like the carrots and the spinach sides.\n\nDessert:\n-Sticky toffee pudding-Delicious, although I would like more ice cream to go with it I would say it wasn't too overwhelmingly sweet which is exactly what I like in a dessert.\n\nDrinks: \n-old fashioned-I loved the burnt orange peel and the sweetness was just right! Had to order a second round!\n-Moscow mule-a light drink to chill with for the night.\n\nI would recommend this place for mini groups, date night, but to keep things safe, make a reservation at least a week in advance! Friendly service so no issues there :)","date":"2018-08-13 06:59:53"}

The place has been renovated into a super modern and classy looking joint, in true Gordon Ramsay style. When you first walk in, you're greeted by a virtual Chef Ramsay, and you can also see photos of all of the past Hell's Kitchen winners.\n\nThe next thing to catch your eye is the open kitchen with chefs dressed in blue and red -- but no, there's no competition happening here. But there was a humble Chef Michelle Tribble -- last season's winner -- doing photo ops with excited diners in between orders.\n\nThe food here is exceptional as anyone has come to expect in any GR restaurant. There are his classic staples like beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding as well as a handful of novelties.\n\nPan seared scallops. Oh my gosh. These are seriously melt-in-your-mouth good. Deliciously charred on the outside and pure nom on the inside.\n\nBeef Wellington. You can't go wrong with this in any of his restaurants. Perfectly cooked medium rare steak wrapped in a thin layer of puff pastry. It's a staple for a reason.\n\nPineapple Carpaccio. This is worth it just for the 'gram. Sweet and tart pineapple slices come out on a giant tray smoking with dry ice. The coconut sorbet pairs so well and makes this the perfect light and refreshing end to a meal.\n\nSticky toffee pudding. Each of GR's restaurants has a different take on this classic English dessert. What makes this one special? Speculoos ice cream instead of vanilla. Oh yes. You read that. Speculoos. Like the stuff that your cookie butter dreams are made of. The texture of this pudding is similar to what you would find at his pub inside Caesar's. I do miss the satisfaction of pouring my own sticky toffee sauce all over the pudding though.\n\nHK is the perfect in-between if you don't want a super fancy meal but also don't want something casual. Make a reservation if you can to avoid the lines.","date":"2018-06-07 22:11:07"}

Our meal and our experience were AMAZING. We sat down and were so intrigued by the many  design details that kept us looking around the room in interest - pitchforks in the light fixtures,  video-walls of flickering flames, gorgeous patterned-marble floors,  an open kitchen tiled half in red and half in blue, napkins with HK's great logo. Even my orange juice  was interesting -- it was adorned with an orange slice  propped atop my glass via a pitchfork toothpick (I wiped it down for a great souvenir!). The food was just incredible and came lighting fast, almost impossibly fast. I had a spicy egg dish with sourdough bread that left my stomach feeling warm and happy. My 12-year-old had a braised short rib off the bone, with polenta, which just melted in his mouth and was so tender that he didn't need a knife.  His unsweetened iced tea was served with a side of agave and he loved it. My husband had seared salmon with lentils. He's picky, and he loved it. Seriously the three of us enjoyed a wonderful meal that was much more than a meal...it was an experience that we will remember. If only every dining-out experience could be like this one! Brittany was our wonderfully helpful & knowledgeable server and put up with a lot of our questions and requests, including our final request to take our pic in front of the open kitchen. She did us one better and asked if we'd like a pic with  the 2018 winner of Hell's Kitchen, chef Michelle Tribble, so we got it. Well done, Hell's Kitchen!","date":"2018-04-01 20:13:57"}

I came here on a Sunday with four people. We had a reservation for 2:30 PM and they couldn't take any more walk-ins because they had so many reservations. So make sure if you want to try this place, make a reservation!!\n\nThe hostess asked if we wanted to sit near the fountain view or the kitchen view. They recommended the kitchen if we were fans of the show. I'm glad they did because they really made the interior look exactly like the set. It was beautiful! You're allowed to take many pictures in front of the kitchen including pictures with one of the winners who is the chef at Hell's Kitchen. \n\nOur waiter was very polite and nice and even connected with us on a personal level. \n\nThe food was very good. I loved the baked pancake, short rib grilled cheese (that had to be my favorite), lobster risotto (which we had to send back because it had no flavor and tasted like rice in water although the lobster was good), and mushroom pizza. We also had to get the infamous sticky toffee pudding which was SUPER delicious. There isn't too much of an overwhelming nutty\/toffee flavor, but more of a soft perfectly balanced blend of sweet and savory. Every bite had me and my friends smiling from ear to ear because the cake was so moist and flavorful. The ice cream was a perfect pairing to the cake. \n\nBesides the botched lobster risotto, the food was delicious, the experience was fun, and Hell's Kitchen was afforable and just an all around really cool experience. They put a lot of thought and work into the restaurant and next time I might come back to try infamous Beef Wellington 3-course special menu for $60.","date":"2018-04-02 16:34:36"}

We weren't very hungry but we got in for lunch and eats had hamburgers. My wife got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I got the regular burger. Both came with fries.

In this case, it was right in front of our resort at Caesar's Palace at Hell's Kitchen (albeit separated by a ramp built for a motorcycle jump over the resorts' kitchen).  Be sure to book WEEKS ahead or you won't get your reservation.\n\nThe theme of the restaurant has heavy doses of the TV show which inspires the name.  The fiery statue out front is even inspired by the graphics for the show.  But if you're not a show viewer (which I'm not) you won't be distracted by the theme -- the show is there on monitors in the dining area, but large windows allow you to see the resort's sculptures and the curved shape of the restaurant feels roomy.  \n\nThe menu has so much to explore and it is worth ordering to share and enjoy.  I HIGHLY recommend Scampi Prawn Flambe, if for nothing else but the theater of cooking on your table (see the video).  But the flavor of the shrimp with the white wine sauce is great on the palate.  I had the Crispy Skin Salmon but only because my dinner partner had the Beef Wellington which I was going to try come Hell('s Kitchen) or high water.  The salmon was creamy, buttery and flavorful -- but lacking a small kick of salt or spice. The skin was perfectly done.  The bites of Beef Wellington I was allowed to try were perfectly done and the pastry was delicious.  The Sticky Toffee Pudding was the obligatory finish and was good but a finish that begged for an espresso or Port to accompany it.\n\nService was tremendous.\n\nThis is the latest \"must-try\" high-end restaurant in Las Vegas.  But with so many other restaurants at the same price point and navigation around The Strip so difficult, I wouldn't recommend Hell's Kitchen as a destination point unless you're a huge fan of Ramsey or just want to try a very nicely done Beef Wellington.  But, if you're in the area, DO IT.","date":"2018-07-15 08:20:22"}

The decor is bright and bold and in your face, but everyone from the hostess to the guy who refills your water was friendly and professional. The contrasting impressions seem like a reflection of the owner's personality. And, yeah, one half of the kitchen staff wears blue and the other wears red, just like on the show.\n\nFortunately, the food lives up to the expectations. We started with the wagyu meatballs, which has such a fantastic beef flavor that it almost didn't need the (excellent) sauce and the (fresh and chewy) mozzarella. The Caesar salad was nothing special (just lettuce, a cheese tuile, and a few croutons), but the tangy dressing was a nice surprise. I really wish I had gotten a second order of meatballs instead. \n\nThe short rib grilled cheese sandwich was phenomenal. This is was really all about the beef, but the creamy cheese worked perfectly with it. It came with fingerling potato chips, which were tasty but small and crumbly (since fingerlings are small). The New York Strip was perfectly prepared and tasty. \n\nAnd, service was outstanding throughout. Definitely worth a return visit.","date":"2018-02-20 03:11:18"}

I would watch the show and admire how amazing and delicious his food looked and could only hope to eat there one day! I knew I was going to go to Las Vegas in February and heard that this restaurant was opening right around that time, once reservations became open I booked it IMMEDIATELY, probably around November. \n\nWhen we arrived the hostesses were great, the atmosphere, decor, music, everything was lovely. I really thought I was in for the best food experience of my life. \n\nWhen we got sat down, it took around 10-15 minutes to even be introduced to our waiter and we finally got our menus. It took another 15 minutes to get asked for our order. \n\nWe decided to order an expensive bottle of champagne, only for it to be served HOT. I'm talking like very very very warm, not even room temperature. It took around 40 minutes for it to be chilled in ice and water. It took so long that we ended up ordering beers while waiting for our bottle to be \"chilled\". \n\nAfter that, my little brother had ordered Mac and cheese, only for it to be served to us EXTREMELY cold, not even warm but freezing like it had been made hours ago. It was thick and dry as well. They immediately made him a new one which was great and definitely up to par with our expectations. \n\nFinally when the adults got served their food, we immediately had to return one entree, the short rib. It was dry, burnt, and had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever. I had ordered a beef Wellington, which I had at Gordon Ramsey steak months before (which was the most amazing thing I had ever had)... and it was NO WHERE NEAR as good. It was tasteless honestly. No seasoning, no flavor, not even near as good as it was at his steak restaurant in Paris Las Vegas. I also ordered mashed potatoes as a side dish, only for it to be extremely watery and thin, not creamy. I left the entire thing.\n\nOverall..... this was the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced in my life when it comes to a restaurant. I had the highest expectations, only to be served outback steak quality for the price tag of triple of that. It was honestly horrible and I am so upset about my experience here. I wish Gordon could have been in town so he could've screamed at the food they were serving and probably fired everyone that took part in making it for even letting it out of the kitchen. This is DEFINITELY not to Gordan's expectations and I hope that he realizes that soon before his reputation is impacted. \n\nWorst part is we had all these terrible experiences and did not get credited one thing.... we ended up spending over 500 on the most mediocre and horrible food. Definitely will not be returning and I definitely don't think this place is worth your money whatsoever,go to Gordan Ramsey steak across the street.","date":"2018-02-20 04:39:18"}

It was nearly 100 degrees in the lobby. After waiting for 20 minutes (and sweating for 20 minutes) we were finally seated...at probably one of the worst tables in the place. A spot on the floor where there shouldn't even be a table. Right in the middle of the main walkway from the large dining room leading to the perimeter dining areas. We were both bumped into by shoulders and purses no less than 10 times throughout our dinner. (We were told the restaurant was \"full\" and we couldn't be re-seated.) The water boy immediately poured tap without even offering sparkling or bottled water, which we would have purchased, but we were parched thanks to the overheated lobby, so there was no time to quibble. The waiter came to present menus, handed me one, and used my dining companion's menu as a visual aid to point out things for about 3 minutes. It was SO loud that we could barely hear him. Tip: give all guests a menu and THEN sell it. Cocktails were decent. The prawn flambé appetizer was $24 and included just three flavor-lacking shrimp. The saving grace was the entrees. The lamb and beef wellington were perfect. Well-seasoned, appropriately priced. The server assistant pulled a big no-no. Picked up our water glasses by the rims and the silverware to clean our table between courses. Then set the silverware down on a freshly-chemicaled table. We had him remove it all and replace. The sticky toffee pudding was delicious, but if you're going to serve ice cream on top of cake, the ice cream shouldn't be rock hard. Very difficult to eat. Our server, Chris, had zero personality. Many times, a good server makes up for other minor faults, but not here. On the menu, you'll find a small handful of entrees and a few steaks. Advice - skip the steaks, there are countless incredible steak houses on the strip - and come up with more inventive dishes. After one visit, I have absolutely zero reason to go back. This place could be so much more, but it just falls flat.","date":"2018-07-16 15:41:16"}

We had reservations for 1945 on a Wednesday.  The greeters located the reservation and suggested that they were running 10-20 minutes late.  OK -- given the high yelp ratings and crowd in the lobby, we can believe that.\n\nLong story shortened, around 2105, we see a group of 6 that had arrived a half hour later than we had get seated, with one greeter telling the other that \"Manny had taken care of it.\"  It did seem that Manny had some rapport with the folks, but the other half was having none if it... got Manny's attention with some active finger waggling and a quick inquiry about failed queuing and, mirabile dictu, got promised a table close to the kitchen (it wasn't, it turned out) and free drinks to try to smooth things over (decent gesture, that's why  two stars, not one).  Note to reception... never let people see or hear what's really going on... it just stirs the hive and angers the bees.\n\nWait staff was efficient and attentive, orders were taken and food appeared in a timely fashion thereafter.  Some of us opted for the Prix fixe menu.  My scallops were thin (I get it -- 5 full sized scallops is more of a main and they take longer to sear, cut 'em in half!).  Sadly, that makes them a lot easier to get a bit on the over done side.  The flavor was quite good (in the US sense; not the UK pejorative use).  My Wellington was big... bigger than it needed to be, but it's temperature profile (not the done-ness) says it was being punched out in a production line and sitting under a heat lamp.  \n\nThe other half got the pumpkin soup and declared it to be insanely rich.  Her meatballs were tasty, but had too much tomato sauce to meat ratio for her taste (N.B.: as a comparison point, she suggests comparing to the \"kick-ass meat loaf\" at Brenda's Meat & 3 in SF).  \n\nWe shared some of the sticky pudding dessert and both concluded it was tooth-achingly sweet.  All three of these ordered at our table went back half eaten (amongst 6 people)... not a good consumption ratio.","date":"2018-04-14 07:15:38"}

Service was friendly and attentive. Water was always filled and our server checked in several times and seemed to really like the food. White asparagus soup had good asparagus flavor but needed more salt ... but no salt nor pepper at the tables, had to ask for it. Lastly, sticky toffee pudding ... very sweet so the ice cream was necessary to cut the sweetness ... the 1 scoop was only enough for 1\/2 the cake so we had to leave 1\/2 the cake uneaten. As I dined, I saw lots of tables around me also leave their cake unfinished .... such a waste and poor balance, needs 2 scoops. Michelle, the Las Vegas restaurant season winner, was there visiting tables...though I never saw her in the kitchen (???). They should do a 15 min show every 2 hours of loud \"yes, chefs!\" and the head chef calling the tickets...or a live\"battle\" of the kitchens to finish orders for 4 random tables each.

I arrived at the restaurant late Saturday night January 13, 2018 and was told by Tim Baer, the bartender, to return Sunday and I could sit at the bar for a meal and special cocktails. So I returned at 10:50 AM on January 14, 2018 and gave my name to the hostess. At 11 AM sharp, I was seated at the table I selected since I wanted the Hells Kitchen experience watching the chefs who wore red and blue chefs coats like the television show. I was greeted by our server, Omar. Omar provided excellent service and was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. I asked his thoughts on the type of drinks such as cocktails wine etc. that would go well with the food. His suggestions were taken and the choices were excellent and complimented the food I ordered. Joanna kept our water glasses filled and the way she poured the water was splendid. She covered the opposite side of the glass so that no water splashed. She cleared the table as I finished each course. During my visit I observed Omar with other guests and he showed his professionalism as did Joanna. The only thing I missed out on was meeting Chef Christina as she was not available and that would have been over-the-top to have met her and possibly get a picture of her or Gordon Ramsay himself. After consuming a Mimosa with my scallops and red wine with my braised short rib grilled cheese sandwich and chips, I had the famous sticky toffee pudding and cocktail called pitchfork and chef stew which was amazing. On Monday, January 15, 2018 I arrived hoping to see Chef Christina with no luck but was greeted by Tim Baer who served me a cocktail called notes from Gordon with an actual note from Gordon and another chef's stew. I complimented those drinks with the lobster risotto which again was fabulous. My visit far exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend this place. I also was able to meet Chef Murphy. She was a nice person and very pleasant to talk to. She listened and cared what I had to say. She was also attentive to all the chefs cooking in the kitchen.

I decided to get the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which has a Fresno chili jam and a ghost pepper jack cheese. They serve breakfast all day, so I asked if the could add a fried egg to the burger. I was told that they \"couldn't\". \n\nWe also couldn't get the lawash bread that they offer at dinner. Apparently, no customization is allowed (though removing things - like a tomato from a sandwich - is okay). Disappointing.\n\nThis time, the service wasn't so crisp. The water guy ended up doing most of the work with refills and catching up to the waiter with clarifications to our meal. He did a stellar job, but the waiter shouldn't just be there to take the order and give us the bill (other people delivered the food). We often had to get the water guy to find the waiter.\n\nThe burger was tasty - just spicy enough without being overpowering - but also ice cold by the time I got it. The waiter quickly took it back to be remade. It took about 5 minutes, and it was flawless. The guacamole and fresh tomato balanced the spicy elements, and I could still taste the beef in the perfectly seasoned chuck.\n\nThe chicken Caesar salad, grilled chicken sandwich, and New York strip that the rest of the table ordered were prepared properly and without issue. But, that's because they were being made while my burger was sitting out and getting cold.\n\nStill worth a return trip, but I'm a little disappointed at the issues I had on an $182 bill (and no offer to comp or otherwise make up for the mistake on the burger).","date":"2018-02-22 22:01:19"}

We got there and the atmosphere just grabs you and pulls you in. Moderate conversation filling the air, dim lightening, and a fun server. After a few minutes of looking over the menu. We decided on a few dishes to order. The Mac and cheese was cheesy, evenly seasoned, and surprisingly a generous portion for the size. Which everything was perfect for me, except two things. One was the complimentary dish. I can't remember the name. But a cube of watermelon, a creamy cheese, pepper, and a garnish. Although it did a great job covering many different flavors at once. Sweet, bitter, tangy, etc. It just wasn't something I could see myself eating again. Although I didn't like it, someone somewhere will come here and love it. The second thing was the Caesar salad. It just tasted of lemons, not a zest, everything tasted like a lemon. This may just be because I ordered without meat, who knows. But I just let the server know and they removed the dish from my bill. My friends enjoyed the Lobster Risotto, Jidori chicken scallopini, and a few drinks!

I think it lives up to the Gordon Ramsey name and the Hell's Kitchen hype. \n\nMy girlfriend and I came here to celebrate Valentines day and it was a great decision. We ordered a pre-fixe meal and additional food on the side as well. The pre-fixe menu came with scallops as the appetizer, beef Wellington for the entree and sticky toffee pudding as the dessert. We additionally ordered lobster risotto and Mac and cheese. The scallops were seared perfectly and they had just the right amount of seasoning. It was served with a celery slaw\/salad sort of thing which paired greatly. Our entree was the Beef Wellington and it was definitely the highlight of the night. I'd been out on the hunt for beef Wellington for quite some time. I even tried making one on my own but nothing ever compared to this. Their beef was so tender and juice on the inside and the mushrooms and the jus and the puff pastry just all came together into tasty bites after tasty bites! The puree and roasted veggies also paired greatly with the protein. As for our additional dishes: the lobster in the risotto tasted extremely fresh. The Mac and cheese, however, was to die for. It tasted so rich and so cheesy but at the same time I felt myself reach for more and more. We had some leftover and that tasted better than some other 5 star Mac and cheeses. Their sticky toffee pudding was about the only thing that I didn't enjoy. It was way too sweet for me and my girlfriend. She's a sweet tooth and dessert queen but even she thought it was too poor sweet.\n\nThe 4 star rating comes from the fact that our meal ended up taking 2 hours because they were kind of slow on bring out our food.

Three ordered the filet and I ordered the Beef Wellington. We ordered two sides of potato augratin and one side of Mac n cheese, and meatballs for an appetizer. All were served in very warm skillet like dishes, however the actual food was barely warm. The filets looked more like sirloin steaks, not the thick, cut with a butter knife kind of filets. I think the sides were probably put in an oven and not allowed to get hot. When my sister ordered her steak 'medium rare' the server commented, 'That's the way Gordon would prefer you order you steak.'  Someone needs to check with Gordon and ask if he prefers the food that is served be hot.

I would also like to compliment their customer service because one of the waiter spilled a dressing on the floor and some splashed at my bf's white shirt and hair. My bf wasn't bothered by it. The waiter was very apologetic and attentive making sure everything was ok, then the manager came checking on us asking if we're staying at the ceasar palace so they can have my bf's shirt dry cleaned.

Between three of us we tried to order different dishes and share so we can experience all the delicious foods..... NOT! Appetizers were ok, but you can get them in any half decent restaurant. The main dishes were quite disappointing. Signature dish, beef Wellington, had soggy pastry around a nice piece of meat which wasn't anything special worth calling signature dish.  All the dishes were room temperature (not hot) and hardly average . I have to say the quality of meat and ingredients were good but they put ZERO effort to give them character other than simple decoration. Desert was better, specially the sticky toffee pudding, it was really good. But again coffee and latte were lower than average. The whole time I was hoping he'd walk from the kitchen, take my plate and throw it to the back saying this is a F***king dissaster and fire everyone in the kitchen but it didn't happen..... Maybe he reads this and then decides to randomly show up at the restaurant and taste his own food  before trash talking too much about other foods in TV or maybe he hires me to help and tell him how he can make it better  \n\nNote: I go to lots of restaurants around the world and spent long part of my life in NY, so I have high expectations specially when I go to a well known chef restaurants.","date":"2018-08-11 10:39:20"}

Fast forward to 1\/28 and got a chance to eat this place for lunch. I'm amazed I even got a reservation since I would think this place gets booked fast. The restaurant is beautiful and you can see a bit of the show.\n\nThe food here is very good but the service time is a bit too long. I can almost hear Gordon Ramsey start yelling at the staff for taking such a long time. I wasn't sure if it's just that since it's so new they haven't got everything down but I would think someone like Gordon Ramsey wouldn't allow such a thing. For that, I would give this place a 3.5 but I'll round up since the servers (Britney) were excellent and the food was amazing. I just wished they came quicker (lobster risotto took over 35 mins!) that is probably unacceptable on the show. \n\nI got the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was very tasty. I usually don't like bacon in my burger but it wasn't super overpowering. It was a bit on the saltier side but I can live with it. Was a bit spicy but didn't bother me. \n\nWife got the crispy salmon and I thought the crispy skin was excellent.\n\nFor dessert the pineapple carpaccio was awesome. Definitely on the refreshing side and very tasty. I would probably come back and try the dinner tasting menu. They really need to step up on being quicker. Lots of tables were just sitting around.\n\nTotal cost for all of that $99.","date":"2018-01-28 22:52:04"}

Foie Gras (hoping I spelled that right): Not at all what I expected, but perfectly prepared. A great mix of flavors in little bites of happiness. \n3. The Sticky Toffee Pudding: I mean commmeee oonnnnnnnn ... it was moist and decadent, yet not too heavy. Served with ice cream (b\/c obviously) and the perfect way to end the meal. \n4. The Presentation: They take their presentation seriously here, as well they should with the GR name attached. Everything from the drinks to the desserts was amazingly presented. Best presentation of all was the \"smoke on the blvd\" cocktail... order it, just trust me. \n5. The Staff: Very rarely have I met a staff that was so professional and still very down to earth and cool.

Because it had just opened a few weeks ago this restaurant was on the local news as so far taking in about 100k reservations already and is fully booked for a few months.\n\nI have been a huge fan of the show since day 1 and watched the first 11 seasons religiously.  I was not aware that this place had opened in Las Vegas and only thought it opened recently in Los Angeles.  \n\nWe decided to hit the bar and see if we could wiggle into 4 bar stools and dine in at some point.  We got to the bar at around 9pm and had a few drinks to start.  At around 9:30pm we all sat down at the bar next to each other and were able to order dinner. \n\nFor starters i ordered the Smoke on the Blvd cocktail.  This consists of \"Woodford Rye, Aperol, Amoro Averna, sweet Vermouth, smoked with cherry wood\"  The drink is made and then placed into a glass smoker which smokes the drink right in front of you.  This drink was perhaps one of the best drinks i have had in quite some time.  \n\nI ordered off of the tasting menu with wine pairing on the menu which went for $120.00.  I was thinking to myself for $120.00, I probably wont be getting that much food and was preparing myself to be leaving the restaurant still hungry.  I was wrong. \n\nThe first course i got was scallops, which were cooked \"spot on.\"  The scallops were cut in half and cooked which of course made them a pretty light app, but they hit the spot.  The wine pairing for this course was a 2016 Marsanne Tahbilk, Nagambie Lakes Central Victoria.  It was a perfect match and great start to the meal. \n\nFor dinner the beef wellington was great and cooked perfectly with a small side of mashed potatoes puree and vegetable medley.  It was paired with a 2013 Jordan Cab (one of my top 3 favorite reds) so this meal was an instant winner.  \n\nFor dessert the sticky toffee pudding was AMAZING.  But the star of this show was the dessert wine.  A 2011 Castellare, San niccole, vin santo del chianti classico.  It was tremendous.  The service was amazing.  I also tried my friends lobster risotto and it was delicious.  5 stars, and I will definitely be back.  Before leaving I was able to meet Hell's Kitchen season 10 winner Chef Christina Wilson (who is the executive chef at that location)  and was able to get a photo with her and funny enough, we had a great, pretty lengthy talk about NFL football rather than food, as we are both from the East Coast and follow the East Coast teams.  An all around phenomenal experience, especially if you are a fan of the show.  The kitchen is set up like the TV Show complete with the actual chefs of the place dressed like the TV Show contestant. (in red and blue jackets).  I will 100% be back and can't wait for my next visit here.","date":"2018-02-09 07:29:06"}

Well after trying it here at Hell's Kitchen I can say that it is well worth the hype. The steak was cooked beautifully and melted in my mouth. It went well with the puff pastry that was golden brown. \n\nAlthough the Beef Wellington was the star of the show, everything else was just as delicious. My boyfriend opted for the prix fixe menu and his meal came with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. We dreaded what was to come because we were so full off of appetizers and the Beef Wellington. \n\nHowever, once we had a bite of the Sticky Toffee Pudding it was as if we died and went to heaven. It is a very unique dessert that I highly recommend getting here. The cake was moist and soft. The vanilla ice cream that came on top of the cake paired well with the warmth of the cake.\n\nHonestly, this restaurant is the epitome of fine dining. Everything about the dinner went great, from the waiters to the food. I think the only con about this restaurant was the fact that we had to wait for our table a bit which wasn't surprising seeing as it was at full capacity.

The most glaring was the desert- how is it possible that his signature sticky toffee pudding was mundane here and yet the next night, at his Pub and Grill on the same hotel property, it was spectacular (as expected)? The HK pudding was dry - a 5 our if 10. The Pub's pudding was moist and perfect- 10 out of 10!! Other food issues- the lobster risotto wasn't warm. And the beef Wellington was under seasoned. I have done Gordon's recipe for it at home and was expecting the restaurant to at least make it as well as I did. Someone was clearly not following instructions to Season every layer. The last ding is on the bar staff - two of our party ordered the same cocktail. One was perfect the other was a sugary sludgy mess. (Which the waitress immediately replaced).

We had the lobster risotto, as well as, the wagyu meatballs for our appetizers. I ordered the salmon for my entree and it was cooked perfectly. The texture was to die for - the skin was slightly crunchy and the fish itself nice and flaky. There was also a wonderful sauce that was draped over the salmon that had a really nice taste. My husband ordered the NY strip steak and he said the flavor was on point and it was very tender.  For dessert we ordered the sticky toffee pudding and ice cream. It was soooo good. I can't say anything more than you just have to try it for yourself.  There is nothing like it. I have to say, however, the best part of our visit was our server Casey.  From the moment we were seated by the hostess and greeted by Casey we could tell this was going to be an extraordinary experience!  Casey was EXTREMELY personable and made us both feel very welcomed. He was the one who recommended our dishes and we were grateful for his input. Casey also made sure we were comfortable during our entire meal, making sure to consistently check back on us and even recommending things for us to do during the rest of our Vegas stay. He made us feel like we were the only two people in the restaurant due to his direct attention to our experience. I've traveled all over the world, eaten at many different restaurants and even worked in a restaurant myself and I believe attention to detail like this definitely can't be taught; but is due to one's own personal charisma that they bring to a position - particular if they like what they do - and it showed with Casey.  In fact, our entire Hell's Kitchen experience was so good we returned the next day for lunch and specifically asked to be seated in Casey's section to eat again. As expected, he exceeded our expectations. Also, he was spot on again recommending two dishes - the burger for my husband and the short ribbed grilled cheese for myself.  They were both very good.

So far we told our family members to skip out on Hell's Kitchen and go to the burger place instead.\n\nWe probably will never come back here.","date":"2018-03-12 22:38:43"}

As you'd expect it is expensive.  My wife and I dine out a lot at nice places (as you can see in my reviews,) but this was our most expensive meal to date.  Started with the Smoke on the Boulevard.  Awesome drink served in a smokey box.  You could taste the cherry wood in every sip.  We split the Scallops as an appetizer​.  They were perfect.  My wife had the beef wellington and I had the rack of lamb.  I won.  The lamb was so good, I had to look like a country boy come to town when I was picking up the bones to make sure I got every bight.  The Wellington​ was on point too, so if you're not a lamb person it would be a great red meat option.  We also had the smoked gouda pancetta mac n' cheese.  I'm a southern boy who was raised on good mac n cheese, so this was the only thing that didn't blow me away (not to say it wasn't good.). The ambiance​ was great.

I mean i have always been a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and all of his work and just to be in his restaurant was very exciting.\n\nI had the lunch \"table d'hôte\". It costs 60$ ( without wine pairing) and it's totally worth it. With this option, you will have the choice between a ceasars salad or a white asparagus soup. I had the soup and it's delicious!!! Also for the main dish you only have the option of Gordon's signature dish: the beef wellington, which is also yummy :).

We came to Hell's Kitchen to celebrate our anniversary. Our decision proved the be the right one. Our server Michael's knowledge and explanation of everything was beyond impressive. He broke down each menu item, explained their flavor profiles and suggested other food a drink pairings to accentuate each item. Michael suggested we start with the seafood tower. By far this was the best seafood tower we have ever eaten. Every item on the tower lacked for nothing. Chefs selection of where every item comes from to the preparation were exquisite. We then had the famous lobster risotto. The moment it arrived to the table the aroma grabbed our attention. The temperature and flavor so good I cannot put it in words. All I can say is if you go there your experience would be incomplete without ordering it. The next course was the Beef Wellington. First I must tell you we only eat seafood. But the reputation deserved a break in diet. Again the decision was one I do not regret. We added the black diamond truffle shaved on top by the chef, as suggested by Michael. The Wellington deserves every bit on the accolades it receives. There was nothing about it that reminded me it was meat. Perfectly cooked and the flavor was incredible. Michael recommended the perfect wine to accompany it, which my fiancée thoroughly enjoyed, which is very difficult when it come to red wines. But there is more. Of course we ordered the sticky toffee pudding, and a slice of the cheesecake for good measure. The cheesecake was as advertised; so light and nothing like a cheesecake we have ever eaten. If I had any critique at all and it is difficult to do so, it is the peanut butter. I do like peanut butter, but it overpowers the lightness of the cheesecake and the other flavors . The sticky toffee pudding capped off this amazing dinner experience. Gordon's staff  has this recipe executed perfectly. It is hard to believe that after all the other courses anything could have surprised us with its perfection as this dessert did. As fans of Gordon Ramsey and his shows, we had to at least experience Hell's Kitchen one time. But after this amazing night which fulfilled everything we could have asked for. The atmosphere, energy, service, food and drink, deserves all of the 5  stars  and more. A huge thank you to Michael and his superior service, knowledge and dedication to make our meal a great experience. Louie the Owner stopped by our table to inquire if everything was satisfactory , to which with smiles of satisfaction insured him everything was far greater than satisfactory.","date":"2018-09-22 18:40:52"}

First came a choice of pan seared scallops or caesar salad. Then came beef wellington as the entree. Dessert consisted of sticky toffee pudding w\/ice cream.\n\nThe pan seared scallops seemed well-seared and not overcooked. The puree garnish added contrast to the scallop sear's texture. The braised lardons and pickled apples made for an interesting palette; the contrast between the smoky richness of the lardons and the tangy pickling playfully juxtaposed each other, allowing neither to dominate the palette.\n\nThe beef wellington arrived textbook rare. The fillet remained consistently tender, and the pastry's buttery flavor enhanced, rather than overpowered the fillet. The potato puree had all the flavor of a freshly mashed potato without the overbearing richness.\n\nFor the sides, the roasted cauliflower could have done without the crumbs (personal preference). The chili lime brightened the cauliflower significantly. The wild mushrooms oozed umami; I wanted an entire bowl. The baked mac 'n cheese, while good, seemed lackluster in comparison to the other items.\n\nThe dessert, however, stole the limelight of the night. The pudding itself, reminiscent of cantonese rice pudding\/缽仔糕, possessed a subdued savory sweetness. The coffee?-flavored ice cream and the toffee syrup turned the pudding into a symphony of chocolate coffee richness. Had I had the stomach capacity, I would have downed the entire dessert. Alas, I had but one stomach to give that night, so I managed only to finish half.","date":"2018-02-21 03:10:06"}

We were told we could sit anywhere in the bar area, so we found a hightop and sat down. After being sat there for a few minutes, one of the servers came by and told us we could not sit there, which was fine! His delivery was a bit to be desired, though... something along the lines of \"why would you think you can sit here? this table is dirty\" Ok, so we moved to the bar where there were 2 seats open, but not next to each other. We politely asked a couple to move down a seat so the 2 seats were together. They were super friendly and agreed (they even bought us a drink after, for some reason!). As soon as we sat down, though, the bartender basically scolded us for not telling him to tell them to move down. He quite sternly \"educated\" us the proper procedure at a bar is always to ask the bartender. Is that true? \n\nAnyhow, other than some not-so-friendly staff, the place was great.

The staff were very friendly and accommodated my request. I ordered the Cesar salad with grilled chicken. The chicken was cooked good, but they must have waited a bit too long to serve me the dish being that some slices of the chicken were a lil dry. The restaurant was packed so I gave them a pass.

I have been to many of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants and this was by far, the worst.  The server was like a robot, and my beef wellington that they are so famous for, was overcooked with a side of cold potatoes.  When I ordered a glass of wine, he started walking away before my husband could order one. Which took 20 minutes - our food came before our drinks. When it was all said and done, our server did nothing to entice us to come back, nor did he seem to care that my food was not cooked to temperature. $250 dollars later, an overcooked entree with cold sides and luke warm service, we would have thought we might get offered a discount off the bill, complimentary dessert, or discount on a future visit. Unfortunately, I don't think we will be returning and I will bet Chef Gordon would not be happy to hear of this poor customer experience. \nThat being said the appetizer was amazing, and our service at the bar was pretty good. If we did come back, it would probably be for drinks at the bar, or possibly to try their more creative lunch menu.","date":"2018-07-16 23:33:36"}

Food was generally good. Nothing super innovative, but well executed wellington, scallops and risotto.  Basically what you would expect from GR.  Tomahawk steak was done properly but quite frankly I doubt it was the promised 32 oz.  There are far better $125 options in town.  Real issue was service.  Our waiter never delivered the amuse bouche that other sections were getting. Drinks came after 2 or our 3 apps showed up, and then we waited 15 mins for scallops.  The server glanced at our table but seemed unconcerned as we had to flag down another server after 10 mins. Side dishes showed up when we had finished mains. The chef came around and was very friendly, talking with the two fans in our group.  When she asked how things were we were honest and she apologized and sent over a dessert. At the end of the day this is a place where I don't expect the food to break any new ground, and it was quite good, if pricey.  But I can't see any excuse for indifferent service.","date":"2018-08-11 03:46:07"}

From start to finish, it was an impeccable experience.\n\nWe had a 5:30pm reservation and was seated promptly by the lovely hostesses. Lucky for us, we were seated up front by the kitchen. \n\nOnce we were settled into our chairs, our server greeted us with the concept of Hell's Kitchen. Kerry was warm and very knowledgeable. We ordered drinks and Cris was quick to pour water.\n\nAs for cocktails, the Notes From Gordon and Smoke on the Boulevard, are the way to go. My husband loved the refreshing aspect of the NFG. He usually dislikes green tea, yet loved it. The Smoke is my go to. Similar to a Boulevardiere, it is smoked using cherry wood. \n\nWe placed in our appetizers and everything was superb. I loved how every dish was dropped with an explanation. We got the wagyu meatballs, lobster risotto, smoked golden beets salad, tuna tartare, and seared foie gras. My mom and dad loved the risotto and tuna tartare. My husband gravitated to the meatballs and beet salad. We all agreed the foie was decadent and perfect. All great choices.\n\nFor our main courses: my parents both got the signature Beef Wellington. My husband, the NY Strip. I ordered the Rack of Lamb. For side dishes: we ordered mac and cheese, potato gratin, sugar snap peas, and roasted cauliflower. There was not a dish we did not enjoy. We ended up packing some of our dishes to go.\n\nThe management team approached tables to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. These were some of the nice touches.\n\nOpulence is the word to describe our dessert service. We received the Peanut Butter Fudge Cheesecake, Pineapple Carpaccio, Chocolate Mouse Cake, and the signature Sticky Toffee Pudding. Each member of the party gravitated towards one specific dessert. Ending with the Kracher dessert wine and a Meet Your Maker was perfection. \n\nEven though the restaurant was busy. Everyone was so personable. It was a wonderful experience and I could not be happier. My family loved their time at Hell's Kitchen.","date":"2018-06-17 05:04:57"}

We even had a little dessert, the pineapple carpaccio with sorbet; it was the coolest presentation I've ever seen. A little dry ice in the middle of the large plate\/goblet plus a little water made a beautiful visual impact- it made everybody near us stop look over at our table. We had strangers coming over to ask us what we ordered! It was also delicious and so light. In addition to that, Michelle Tribble was there and she stopped by our table; my aunt loved that.

We did let our waiter know that we were a little pressed for time bc we were going to see a show. It feels like he still took a little while but the restaurant was a little busy. The biggest turn off was that we asked for the best wine for our dinner and he proceed with \"well the cheapest...\". Not sure if we portrayed that we were on a budget but it was extremely rude. However, the guy who gave us the wine was very kind and considerate and gave us great options and choices. I ordered the salmon and potato gratin, one of my friends ordered the steak and the other ordered the meatballs and macaroni. We all were in love!

It all started with the unfriendly hostess, the first impression of how your experience will be. We arrived a little early for our reservation and they were running a little late. No smile and no sense of feeling welcomed to the restaurant. A shame to start your experience like that. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated with a clean modern look. \n\nThe lady who seated us was very welcoming and friendly, apologizing for the wait. Then we sat for quite a long time with no menus and no server, this was the theme for service tonight.  Once she arrived and dropped off the menus she again disappeared for a long time. We were asking ourselves \"where is she\". She finally came back and took our orders. She highly recommended the shrimp flambe which we ordered. We also ordered the HK caesar, crispy skin salmon, rack of lamb and a side of mac & cheese. I ordered a glass of wine and the pour was pretty stingy, it looked liked maybe 3 oz. \n\nThe scampi flambe was 3 shrimp that they light on fire at the table for $24. It is described as \"garlic white wine sauce\". This was the worst dish of the night. It was very bland with no garlic or white wine flavor at all. The HK caesar was one of the best caesar salads Ive had. The lemon zest gave it a bright citrus flavor that was perfect with the salad. The rack of lamb was standard, although quite fatty, even for lamb. The crispy skin salmon was another let down. Although the fish was cooked perfectly, the skin was not only soft, but very salty. The side of mac & cheese was flavorful but very thick and dense.\n\nWe ordered the infamous sticky toffee pudding for dessert and it definitely lived up to its reputation. So soft and moist, served warm with toffee sauce it was the highlight of the dinner.  With poor service by the hostess and server and the disappointing appetizer and entrees I was let down and expected a much better experience.","date":"2018-02-19 17:35:23"}

The main catalyst for us even being here was because one of our birthday celebrants (our dear friend who definitely IS a fan of the show) really wanted to try this place.  Lucky for her (as well as the rest of us) that this ended up being a fantastic idea.\n\nUpon walking towards the entrance, one might say it is like a futuristic gateway to hell itself.  I bet that was what they were trying to go for.  And that's only the beginning of what we see from the decor.  They have a wall of past winners as well as merchandise for sale.\n\nThe place is huge and seems to seat many people.  And yet, it gets filled seemingly to capacity at prime time.  Even later at night, guests continue to be seated when tables are freed up and prepared.\n\nEven with a reservation, we still had to wait for a while, which didn't exactly surprise me since the place is ridiculously popular.\n\nThe kitchen is in clear sight and open for all to see.  It is not an actual show, but it is modeled after it.  Blue on one side, red on the other.  Bandanas worn on their respective sides of the kitchen.  They're not competing against each other, but they're preparing everything as fast and as fine in quality, presentation, and taste as possible.\n\nI also had a couple of their featured cocktails.  I originally wanted a Manhattan, but for another $1, I royally upgraded to an even more delicious Manhattan that came out of a smokey glass case.\n\nFor food, I went with the 3-course meal featuring the beloved Beef Wellington, which I had never had before.  What a way to be introduced to it for the first time.\n\nHere is a list of all the items we shared and tried:\n\nPan Seared Scallops with Celery root, braised bacon lardons, and pickled Granny Smith apples. $19\nScampi prawn flambé with Garlic white wine sauce and drawn butter. $24\nBeef Wellington with potato puree, glazed root vegetables, and red wine demi-glace. $49\nHerb crusted rack of lamb with vadouvan carrots, bloomsdale spinach, and harissa lamb jus. $39\nPotato gratin with fresh herbs and parmesan cheese. $9\nSticky toffee pudding\nPineapple carpaccio (which was a special and not on the menu).\n\nOur server was so amazing that I had to give him credit, even over the head chef!\n\nFYI:\n\n- As with many places in the area, get ready to spend, spend, spend.\n- If you're going to get a Manhattan anyways, you're better off getting the special one that comes out of a smokey glass box for $1 more.  It's definitely worth the attention from everybody around you.  Plus, it tastes better.\n- The imported sparking water probably goes for as much as Voss, and it's totally worth it.  We went back to drinking regular water, and it was a rough transition.\n\nI personally enjoyed coming here for dinner.  It was a nice treat, and it definitely highlighted the great experiences I've had in this area.  Unfortunately, I only speak for myself as I keep seeing comments on other reviews that the food was mediocre or just not good.  I simply don't agree, but hey, the only good those comments might do for you if you are deterred from trying this restaurant is the fact that you'll save some money.

I have been a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen since season 3. My boyfriend and I watched all of season 17 together, and once I saw the open table reservation made an impulse decision to book one. Best decision of my life. The food is phenomenal. We started out with the wagu meatballs in tomato sauce. Tasted great, looked fantastic, really good for a starter. Then we chose the steak for 2. Which included a 32oz cut of steak and 2 sides. Carbs team so we chose the baked Mac and cheese and potato gratin. Both loved and looked amazing. The Mac and cheese was my favorite. The potato gratin was a little on the oily side but it still tasted great. The steak was awesome also. There was just enough meat to get 2 people full. It came with roasted tomatoes and garlic and mushrooms. So I put a lot of flavor on the steak. I'm a sucker for roasted garlic so that won me over regardless.\n\nThe ambiance was so beautiful. The iconic hella kitchen theme was all over the place. The table placements were so cute. The waiters were so nice and always checked up on us and filled our waters. We had to rush to a 7pm show so I was really sad I didn't get anything from the small gift shop. It's located next to Caesars Palace. So best thing to do I guess would be Uber or taxi, or if you're in no rush you can self park and just walk. \n\nWill I come here again?

Definitely a plus and in huge thanks to extremely accomodating manager, Manny.\n\nWe had an appetizer, entree, and dessert each! not too mention also having very unique and creative libations. They are as follows:\n\nAPPETIZERS\n1) Scampi Prawn Flambe: They put a fire show on your place that is quite the show! if that wasnt enough, dip the prawns into the garlic white wine sauce and drawn butter and this dish melts in your mouth! \nHands down one of the best appetizers we had EVER had. \nAs a side note: i do not like seafood at all but i loved this dish ! \n\n2) Wagyu Meatballs: Very filling,and the mixture of roasted tomato sauce, polenta croutons, parmesan cheese, and basil make this dish a very well rounded dish. \nside note: i dont recommend this dish ONLY if you are choosing the beef wellington as an entree. You will have no space for dessert or maybe you can take a chance like me! \n\nENTREES\n1) Beef Wellington: Cooked to perfection (at a medium rare cook) but that is the way Chef Ramsay wants it cooked and that is the way i had it. \nThe red wine demi glaze potato puree make this all time favorite... OUTSTANDING!\nA true Hells Kitchen Classic! \n\n2) Lobster Risotto: Another Hells Kitchen classic that DOES...NOT disappoint. Each bite with compliments of the butternut squash and sage is HEAVENLY. The lobster just falls apart and it is just SAVORY and unlike any other. I highly suggest pairing this dish with a pinot noir or a cebernet sauvignon \n\nDESSERT\n1) Sticky Toffee Pudding: Just talking about this dessert as i am writing this review makes my mouth water. It is brought out very warm and this dish is complimented by speculoos ice cream. Cut into this dessert, have a bite, and you will know what dessert Heaven has tasted like. \nTruly a favorite and the best dessert i have ever had !\n\nLIBATIONS\n1)Notes from Gordon. Deliciously refreshing and it comes with its very own Chef Ramsays note. it's something to look forward to and perhaps souvenir. \n\n2) Rum Donkey. Cruzan single barrel rum with ginger beer and brown sugar, the mixture of rum and ginger is very odd but is divine! and lets not forget that this drink comes on with a small fire show too of torched passion fruit! \n\n3) Smoke on the BLVD. It comes to you in a wooden glass box and your server opens it up for you. As this happens, smoke comes out and behold.. SMOKE ON THE BLVD. very, very unique. This is hands down my favorite drink on the blvd. It is very strong but it is very worth it  you've...been ...warned!\n\nI am extremely grateful for the opening of this restaurant, have nothing but respect for Chef Gordon Ramsay and would love to thank Manager Manny and our server who provided us with amazing customer service on an unforgettable night!\n\nmake your reservations NOW, you won't regret it!","date":"2018-03-02 07:01:38"}

They infuse their own green tea and peach made in house. It also has a funny message from Gordon included in the drink.\n\nHe ordered:\nLobster Risotto\nCharcuterie Pizza\n\nThe pizza was amazing. Every bite I took was a good balance of cheese and excellent quality charcuterie meats. It was probably one of the best pizzas I've had a restaurant (aside from Italy of course).

I have been to every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Las Vegas and am happy to say that I have checked this one off of my bucket list.  However, I do have some issues that I must bring up.  First of all, my reservation was for 6:30 yet when I checked in the hostess was rather on the rude side.  I am not sure if she was tired or just having a bad day, but she was definitely not welcoming at all.  When I checked in she basically said \"Ok, we will call you when ready\"  I then asked her where I should wait or will I get a pager or anything like that.  She just said that \"she will find me\".  Ok...fine.  We waited and waited and waited, took photos and waited some some more.  There was a friendlier hostess that tried to sell us some over priced T-Shirts while we waited.....finally we got called to our table.  We were handed a drink menu and waited....then finally the waitress took our drink orders and we received our drinks rather promptly.  Then our food orders were taken and this is where the real wait began.  Very simple order.  Beef Wellington with brick chicken...that was it!  We waited 45 minutes for our order to arrive.  I know this place was busy, but seriously...45 minutes!  Finally our order came and it was very good, but I was still shaken by the rudeness of the hostess coupled with rather long wait time.  It was my birthday so they brought me out a sticky toffee pudding, which was very good.  This could have been a very special and unique experience but you seriously need to train your hostesses better on customer service.  They can break your business if you don't watch out.  Our waitress was  pleasant but overworked since she had some rather large and \"needy\" tables to take care besides our own and unfortunately, we got the short end of the stick when it came to her service.  Piece of advice.  When you have larger tables (10 or more people) that reserve commonly, you should have dedicated wait staff for those tables and let other wait staff take care of smaller tables.  Otherwise the small tables will get lost in the shuffle, which is what I believe happened in our case.  I will be returning to Hell's Kitchen in the future, but I must admit that Gordon Ramsay's Steak in the Paris Hotel has their act much more together.\nFinal thought - $15 for a Cesar Salad is a little excessive...it's just lettuce, cheese, croutons, and dressing.","date":"2018-02-22 16:35:46"}

No shame in my game, of course I was going into my dining experience with full on high expeditions! \n\nIf you're worried that you have to wait months on months for a reservation - don't sweat it my friends. I booked through OpenTable and was able to make a late lunch\/ early dinner reservation just two weeks from our desired Wedding Anniversary date. Checking into my resie was super easy, after walking in we were seated right away- since we were celebrating an anniversary I had placed a special request for a window seat overlooking the hustle and bustle of the strip, we had the perfect view! \n\nShortly thereafter being seated, our sweet and attentive server Joseph came by for our meet and greet then went on to provide recommendations, brilliant! Within minutes out fancyshmancy drinks arrived which were both worth every shiny penny of about $15-$16 each! The Note from Gordon was my drink of choice which was light and airy. The hubs opted for the Smoke on the Boulevard which tastes similar to an old fashion just waaaayyyyyy better. \n\nFor dinner, my husband opted for the prefix dinner option which was a decent price of $72 which included 3 courses. The option of a starter (soup or salad), beef Wellington and sticky toffee cake. You must order the Cesar salad. Look, I don't even like Ceaser salad, but they make their dressing in house and it's so flavorful. The Beef Wellington was absolutely delicious. I love me some soft, buttery, slithery meat and the color? Oh baby, that light pink to red center really did it for me. Foodgasmic in your mouth f'sure! To top off our bellies we enjoyed the sticky toffee cake which was accompanied with some good French vanilla ice cream.   \n\nMy course included the braised short rib with a side of the smoked Mac n' Cheese. Holy $$$$$h!t- this was theeeeeee best Mac n cheese I've ever had in the entire state of Nevada! The smoked cheese embedded within, with the crispy crisp top cheese layer and alllllll that bacon crispy toppings on top? I could eat this everyday with its rich, rich flavor. Double orgasmic!\nMy braised short rib was out of this world. Watching it just fall apart from its tenderness, man it was cooked perfectly! \n\nAll that I have to say is I appreciate all the little details. Kudos to an awesome server who truly lived up to my expectations for a restaurant like this. I loved the interior decor which was modern, sleek and clean.

We made reservations months in advance.  We were going to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and if a person can assist others in making their restaurants better and tell the \"truth\" about other chefs' food, well, your restaurant has to be flawless, right?  Nope.\n\nThe decor and service were awesome.  The restaurant is beautiful and our server was great.  He was very attentive and answered any questions we had.  We had someone who was gluten free in our party, so he made sure to always note which items were fine for her.  It wasn't me.  I'm gluten full.\n\nWe ordered some drinks that were great.  Details were fabulous.  The smoked bourbon drink my husband ordered was impressive.  It came in a smoking lantern-like box and had an orange peel emblazoned with the HK logo and a pitchfork cocktail skewer.  I ordered a watermelon agua fresca that was delicious, but really just like a watermelon puree drink.\n\nWe decided to go with the prix fix menu.  This consisted of his signature dishes and one would expect that these were going to be fabulous and showcase the best dishes.  It started with your choice of a Caesar Salad (parmesan cheese frico, garlic croutons, lemon zest) or Pan Seared Scallops (english pea puree, braised bacon lardons, pickled fennel).  I had the salad and was pretty disappointed.  It was a very bland caesar and the parmesan cheese was an odd crunchy addition.  You already have croutons that are crunchy.  To add another crunchy parmesan topping was weird.  The dressing was very blah and did not have much taste.  I don't think there was any lemon zest either.\n\nNext on the prix fix menu is the Beef Wellington.  It came with potato puree, glazed root vegetables, and a red wine demi glace.  Let's start with the Beef Wellington.  It was boring and tasteless.  The filet was okay, but I have had much better.  It also was flavorless.  The duxelle was also just a boring, flavorless mushroom paste.  The pastry fell off as soon as you cut into it.  The potato puree was also just a baby food version of mashed potatoes with no taste, except, you guessed it...potato.  The root vegetables consisted of 2 carrot balls and 2 parsnip balls that were under cooked and had a slight butter flavor, but nothing more.  The demi glace was a saving grace as it helped amp up the flavor slightly.\n\nDessert was the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Speculoos ice cream.  This was good, but way too sweet.  When you need to use ice cream to cut the sweetness, it's a problem.  The cake itself was moist and fine.  The sauce was overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nAll in all.  The service was great, the decor was fun, the experience was good.  The food was lacking.  You will spend about $100-$200 per person depending on drinks and appetizers.  I would recommend just going to the bar for drinks and spending that money on better food elsewhere.  Gordon Ramsay should be ashamed of this place.  He may need someone to come in and help with this kitchen nightmare.","date":"2018-10-21 14:59:05"}

One main reason why we did check this place is because of the beef wellington but nah, half of it doesn't have mushroom inside, potato puree was bland and vegetables were served cold. They don't put enough sauce on entrees and we told it to our server and answered us that we should've tell him which is impossible because of their service as well we can't find him and our entree takes forever to arrive and worst is on asking water we already put our empty glass of water on the corner of the table so they could fill it out but still have to wait for the server in order for them to fill the water up. Mac and Cheese came out a little bit warm which is funny because the runner said to be careful because it is hot.

It was easy to make reservations via OpenTable. There were only lunch slots open so I booked it.\n\nI heard Hell's Kitchen was coming to Caesars Palace and why not go check it out? I love the show and I was looking forward to trying the food. When you get there you check in with the hostess and then stand in line against the wall. The line was not too bad to be seated and we got an awesome table near the window where we can see people walking the strip. What really was cool to me is that they have the kitchen open where you can see the blue and red team making entrees. \n\nThe lunch menu looked good! I ordered the three course meal so I can get the beef Wellington since it isn't on the lunch menu to order. I started with the pumpkin soup. Wow! The mix of chorizo on the bottom and the soup they poured on top of it was very good. Be sure to stir it up so you can mix the flavors. We tried the Wagyu meatballs as an appetizer. Wow!!! The meat was very tasty! The meatballs were pretty filling, but glad we tried it! When my beef Wellington came out, all I can think about is Hell's Kitchen Season 4 episode 7 where Ben was just getting the heat from Gordon with his Beef Wellingtons. The beef Wellington was so good!!!!!!!! Yyyeesss! It was so good. The pastry around it was perfect and the meat was medium rare as expected. The potato purée was so good! The vegetables were cooked perfectly as well. I enjoyed the entire plate. When dessert came out, I was so stuffed. I definitely made room for the sticky toffee pudding. Amazing texture and flavors. Very good!\n\nThe service was amazing!!! The server was so nice and funny. She made our dining experience pleasant. I can't wait to go back. I didn't realize how many restaurants Gordon owns until this trip. He knows what he is doing. The quality of the food is amazing and the taste is to die for!","date":"2018-03-03 15:32:58"}

But taking a reality cooking show, Hells Kitchen, and coverting that to an actual restaurant, was spot on.  For me I want to point out the only one small blemish first before I get into to the good, since there is so much good about this restaurant.  When my wife, 2-year old, and I stepped in to the restaurant to check in for our reservations, it was about a 15 minute wait for our table to be ready.  That's okay since it is a high end restaurant with a lot of guests.  But the waiting area was very hot.  The problem especially for the summer months in Vegas is it gets to 100+ daily, and the waiting area during the afternoon and early evening hours faces the setting sun.  The massive windows, althought filmed and shaded limo black, doesnt block out the heat.  They need to crank up the AC in that area or put up shades\/blinds since it is expected folks wait a bit for their tables.\n\nNow on to the good.  Walking in was like walking in to the actual Hells Kitchen show, with waiters dressed like the waiters in the show and the head chefs and sou chefs were all hollering and talking to each other like how they do it with each ordering of food and service.  The decor was elegant and roomy, reminding me of how roomy and stylish the sets were on Hells Kitchen where they seat guests.  Overall the environment was great and service was quite accomodating for us with a 2-year old.\n\nThe food...ah the food!! We got the classic items from the show, including pan seared scallops, lobster rosotto, beef wellington, and caramel toffee cake for dessert.  Aside from the lobster rosotto, all other items we ordered was part of a prix fix meal which was an excellent deal.  I was a bit skeptical on the food initially because there is always that hype factor when you see something on tv versus actual experience.  Boy was I wrong.  Food looked amd tasted exactly how I imagined.  Amazing!! The pan seared scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly, nice and seared on the outside and soft on the inside.  The lobster in the rosotto was so sweet and suculent it was poached with a lot of heart and effort.  The beef wellington was just wow.  Flaky outer pastry puff surrounding the mushroom filling that wraps around a high end piece of meat.  Its either beef tenderloin or filet mignon, probably mignon, but either way it was tender and soft and cuts like a hit knife on butter.  Melts in your mouth texture.  I recommend if you and whoever you go with if you guys are not super big eaters to get 1 beeft wellington to share so you can order more items.  My wife and I both each had one beef wellington and it was quite filling.  The caramel toffee cake ended the evening and our experience at Hells Kitchen wanting more.  \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant for any occassion, but especially special ones like a birthday or anniversary.","date":"2018-11-11 17:28:37"}

The lobster was tender and the risotto was perfectly cooked. The truffle flavor was perfect and not too strong. The ny steak could have been slightly saltier for my own taste but I dipped some pieces in the red wine sauce on my beef Wellington plate. The beef Wellington was amazing. In retrospect I would have just ordered two beef wellingtons and not ordered the ny steak. The ny steak was a perfect medium rare but I liked the beef Wellington more. I have always liked beef wellingtons but I have never had one this good. Now I'm tempted to make one myself since Gordon showcases this dish on YouTube.

I observed the other patrons in the restaurant & they were not 20 year olds partying. It's normal people who dressed up & came to eat at a nice place. They should shut off the blaring bar music & let the customers enjoy the $280 meal for two. Like other reviewers, I will not go back for a second meal.

They didn't have openings here for dinner so we reserved a time for lunch.  It was faster to walk here from our hotel (Venetian) than drive because of all the traffic and dealing with parking.  I love the decor of the place and the outfits of the servers.  Our server had great recommendations and was super sweet.  She remembered that we had two birthdays in our party of seven so she sent us another free sticky toffee pudding.\n\nThey only serve HALF the beef wellington at lunch time and it comes in a set with salad or soup and sticky toffee pudding for $60.  Not really worth the money if you ask me, since you get a full sized beef wellington at dinner for a similar price.  \n\nWhat's funny is that the pumpkin soup and sticky toffee pudding wowed me more than the beef wellington.  I really enjoyed the pumpkin soup and the chorizo in it was very unique.  I didn't know they would be pouring the pumpkin soup at the table, so I was wondering why they were serving me a nearly empty plate with some chorizo bits in it.  The sticky toffee pudding was liked by everyone in our group of seven.  We all just wished the ice cream to pudding ratio was more equal.  I wouldn't have minded more ice cream and less pudding.\n\nThe Hell's Kitchen Burger was HUGE and delicious - just wish there was a bit more avocado.  It packed a little kick because of the ghost pepper jack cheese.  The fries that came with it were perfect.\n\nI would love to come back in the future to try the lobster risotto which is another popular dish on their show.

If you want to give this place a try after my full review book ahead of time because they get extremely packed ! Why ? Probably because it's everyone's first time lol. Dressing attire is casual, but feel free to dress up as it is a nice location. The inside was nicely decorated. They  have a wall with framed photos of all the winners from all of their seasons. Inside there are hell forks on the ceiling. You can see them cooking from your seat. Service and decor was five stars too bad the food gave this place such a bad rating on my behalf. \n\nFor our appetizers we order the meatballs, the lobster and the hot wings. Appetizers were decent, but the main entrees were bland. The meatballs had a lot of flavor. The cheese and potatoes paired well. The lobster appetizer would have been better if it was hot. You could tell they wanted everything to come out together so it was sitting for a bit. The hot wings, weren't really that spicy. I don't like spicy things and I could bare. The blue cheese dressing was good. Like always plate came with carrots and celery, which we didn't care to touch.\n\nFor our entrees I ordered the brick pressed chicken. Right when I was ready to cut my first piece I noticed a hair right on top. Oh my gosh !!! I told my boyfriend and soon enough my waiter overheard and took it back. My boyfriend got the dry age New York steak and it came out before mine, so once she took my plate back we were stuck waiting. When she finally brought out my plate you could tell it was rushed. It still looked nice, but it had no flavor besides what was on the skin. I enjoyed more of what was beneath the chicken which I believe was kale and carrots diced up. \n\nOverall, overpriced for tasteless food. We should have ate at Outback. I don't mind paying top dollar for good food, but this was such a waste of money.","date":"2018-05-02 01:20:34"}

All of this was after I was told twice in 30 minutes that our table was being set up and would be ready in 5 minutes. While waiting, we grabbed a drink at the bar and I asked the bartender what the signature drink was and he told me he makes a good old fashioned. Turns out they have an actual signature drink menu with about 10 drinks on it. Then we finally get seated for our reservation and we are taken through the main area into the back area and I tell the hostess that we want a table in the main kitchen for the experience. Her response was \"ok, but you're going to have to wait.\" To which I replied \"more than the 30 minutes we had to wait for our reservation?\" We get seated and the waiter gives 2 of the 3 at our table a menu. During the course of our meal, the head chef (winner of season 17 of Hell's Kitchen) asks us if we watch the show and if we have any questions about the show, not how our awful food and service were. I was astonished. When we started telling her about our terrible experience, she didn't even know what we were talking about and kept pushing us back to talking about the show. We were not there for the show, but to experience the cuisine that is \"perfected\" through the yelling and screaming of Gordon Ramsay (in the show) and expecting the same level of meticulously crafted plates.\n\nYou would expect of all places, Hell's Kitchen, a restaurant fashioned from the OCD perfection shown by Gordon Ramsay, would be top notch and not miss a single beat, guess I was wrong.

Michelle was down to earth, super personable and engaging with each of the guests she visited with. My wife brought me here as a birthday surprise since I am huge fan of the show and Gordon Ramsay. The kitchen is set up like something out of a Hell's Kitchen show with the red side vs the blue side. Unfortunately there is no yelling or screaming it's Bloody overcooked or Good God this is raw! The server was over the top friendly and super accommodating with our requests for my bday. He explained the menu in great detail, and all 4 us ended up going with the tasting menu. To start we had Oysters and the lobster risotto, followed by the exact same tasting menu, Scallops, and then the beef Wellington. The scallops I would find out later the restaurant cuts in half so it looks like a flat scallop rather than a full meaty diver scallop. I don't know if thats to save money or cut down on the cook time but it was not ideal. My wife and her friend both sent the scallops back because they were overcooked. The beef Wellington was cooked perfectly for each us, medium rare with a lot of flavor. Having never enjoyed this dish prior I did not know what to expect but it was everything Gordon Ramsay says it is on his TV shows. Michelle even came to the table to shave some truffles onto my Wellington. AMAZING!!!!!!!!! To end the night was a light birthday dessert that closed off a great meal.

I also met Chef Michelle Tribble who won Hells Kitchen last year, who is just an amazing chef; she met with everyone to say hi and she just seems like a great person. But you came on Yelp for food reviews so let's get back to that. I came here on my 30th birthday with 4 other people so we got plenty of food. I started off with a iberico ham flatbread which was phenomenal but was the worst part of my meal if you could believe that. Next I had scallops with a sweet corn puree. The scallops were perfectly golden and went so well with the corn puree, never in my life have I had better scallops. A few people at my table had the lobster risotto. I wanted to try it but my party all gobbled theirs faster than I've ever seen. My main course was of course a Ramsay staple Beef Wellington. Words cannot describe how good this was, perfectly tender filet with a golden puff pastry was just to die for, they seasoned the pastry beautifully and everything just melts in your mouth. I wish I had another one. My girlfriend had the crispy skin salmon which was also amazing. For dessert I had the toffee pudding which is more like a cake which was also one of the best desserts I've ever tasted. If you're a foodie I cant emphasize enough how much you need to go here.

It's more like ridiculously moist cake than pudding (think molten-lava cake).  The caesar salad was super fresh.  The avocado toast really surprised me. I tasted a hint of lime and then it continued to pop with so many notes of other flavors. Like a symphony in my mouth.  I mean, avocado toast!?!  I was wowed.

We were fairly content with his Burger joint that we expected nothing below superb, but out of all things, we were let down by his infamous dish, beef wellington.\n\nAs Gordon would say, it's a disgrace~\n\nMaybe the chef forgot to sprinkle a bit of salt at the end, but everything on that plate was bland as a cardboard and remind you of those dishes you find at a cruise. To be fair, it wasn't that bad, but just expected so much more since it's Gordon's signature dish and I've always had my eyes set on it.  Mind you, everything else was on point!\n\nWe started off with the scallop appetizer, which was to die for, especially the squash sauce that accompanied the dish.  It gave it just the right amount of sweetness and texture to go along with the scallops. As my entree, I ordered the lobster risotto, which is actually from the appetizer menu.  Another perfect dish! Risotto was cooked perfectly, not so soggy and not so hard.  Lobster and risotto was infused with truffle flavor, which I absolutely loved and ate within minutes. As a side to the beef wellington, we ordered the mac and cheese.  While it was pleasing to the eyes, i felt like it was missing 1% of something, which I believe jalapenos should have been added to offset the heaviness. The noodles looked as if it was from scratch and was perfect but with all the cheesiness and carbs, it just needed a bit of a kick. \n\nAs a grand finale, we ordered the pineapple carpaccio.  It comes with bite sized sorbet nuggets on top and a show with liquid nitrogen poured in the middle of the plate.  Whimsical and fascinating!  Sorbet and the foam combination with the pineapple was just flawless.  This dish is the epitome of Vegas and I can see why this place is a hit!\n\nLocation wise, Hell's Kitchen is unmissable, located in front of Caesars.  Walking in, you can actually even buy Gordon Ramsay souvenirs.  Did feel like the seating process was a bit slow, especially with so many empty tables and everyone having reservations.  Maybe to go with the theme, the restaurant wasn't as AC'ed out, but noting that the temperature was a bit high considering the 100+ degree weather outside at the time. Overall interior was fiery and stunning, especially loved the open kitchen\/food runner area.","date":"2018-09-13 20:13:52"}

After watching Gordon Ramsay berate so many hard working people on TV for years I had some pretty high standards for this restaurant. And honestly, it met or exceeded most of those.\n\nWe went for lunch on a Thursday, there was a 15-20 minute wait for a table (which sounds pretty standard for the place) so we grabbed some open seats at the bar. The restaurant itself has a cool, relaxed vibe. The kitchen is framed with a blue\/red Hell's Kitchen mural where you can watch the chefs work. Most everything is plated on dark stoneware or cuts of what appears to be tree stump (earthy feels). \n\nWe both got cocktails which were served in fun tiki cups, one of them has toasted passion fruit which was lit on fire before serving. We started with the lobster risotto which has a sun dried tomato sauce. So creamy and delicious. The only part of the meal that was underwhelming was the short rib grilled cheese (which I ordered but should have known better). It was good, don't get me wrong, but it was still just a fancy grilled cheese you know? The Hell's Kitchen burger, on the other hand, was delicious. A little slow heat builds with the ghost pepper cheese but is countered by avocado and pepper jam: I will dream about this burger. \n\nWe finished with Gordon's famous sticky toffee pudding. It's famous for a reason, people. If you're a fan of any of the words in that name you should try one because you know, when in Rome (Caesar's Palace\/the belly of the beast).\n\nThis place definitely gets points for presentation. Entrees range from $20-$40, so you can make it budge friendly if need be and really not too bad for the strip. There's an area at the entry dedicated to the winners of the show as well as a little gift shop with shirts, shot glasses, aprons, etc. So in the words of Gordon, he makes some f****** great food.","date":"2018-07-07 00:01:46"}

The lunch menu is cheaper.... but not by much.  If you're looking for a quick and cheap bite, look elsewhere.  I don't mean to scare people off, just understand the level of restaurant this is.  \n\nWe started with the Wagyu meatballs.  These easily were the best meatballs I have ever had.  The meat was expertly seasoned and cooked to perfection, the cheese and sauce added so much additional flavor.  It's all tied together with the polenta croutons.  It comes with I believe 5 meatballs.  Good starter for two people.\n\nI ordered the braised short rib while my girlfriend ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger.  Coopers Hawk in Chicago had my favorite short rib, that was until I tried this.  This was the best short rib I have ever had.  Crispy charred crust that gave just the right amount of crunch until you got to the inside of the cut, when the meat just melted in your mouth.  It sits in a a creamy, cheesy potato purée and is filled with cherry tomatoes, carrots and onions.  It is topped off with sprouts.  Expertly designed, well cooked.  \n\nMy girlfriend got the Hells Kitchen Burger.  This would be the cheaper lunch option if you're looking to not spent too much.  A perfect mix of spicy and flavor.  Once again, the meat was cooked just right and is all around super delicious.\n\nIf you're on vacation and are debating on whether to do a buffet or Hells Kitchen, do Hells Kitchen.

Well apparently the Las Vegas kitchen didn't see the show either .\nOur other dining friends were appalled and embarrassed.. my husband and I sort of thought it was so funny because it was inedible and just beyond awful.\n\nWhen I said \"wait, this isn't like an entertainment show and we are expected to get really bad food and it's not part of an act?\" They all said \"no, everything should be perfect\". \n\n  All 6 entrees were cold.. not even warm.. (salmon, beef Wellington, strip steak, short ribs, rack of lamb and chicken scallopini).. All the side dishes  ( mushrooms, potato gratin, macaroni and cheese and Brussel sprouts). were cold, extremely salty ( to the point where you had to think someone in the kitchen was doing it on purpose) and the macaroni and cheese was so congealed and not even gooey ( it was like rotini pasta with white cheese on top.. we couldn't believe it)\n\nEven when management took away the entrees and returned with them 'hot' , we just smiled and accepted their assistance and no one ate the returned entrees.. we picked at them. They were still not edible and we were already over and done with this dining experience by that point.\n\nIn my life I never had such an epic failure for a dinner.. It was hysterical and we all started to make jokes about how bad the food was.. The servers tried their best to smooth it over but it was a complete fail.  At some point we had already gone online and made alternate dinner plans at another restaurant, knowing that this was a complete mistake.\n\nThe polenta and vegetables were cold.. The lamb was overdone. The Wellington had an odd taste to the puff pastry.. the salmon was not flavored at all.. and the NY Strip was so tough, even at medium rare, that you couldn't chew it.. And the short ribs?? DRY DRY .. so dry.. and stringy.. How is that possible???\n\n Management was wonderful as were the servers.. they did offer a discount and a couple complimentary desserts, but even with that the bill was over 450.. what a waste of money.  In hindsight, we should have walked out and not paid.\n\n But the kitchen is a whole bowl of WRONG.. a complete mess.. Another table leaned over and said they didn't have the nerve to speak up and ate their cold unappetizing meals because they figured they had no right to say anything.. \nAnd a lovely couple sitting by the window walked over and said a similar thing to us, too..\n\nBut all 6 of us very much spoke up ( 3 members of the dining party are 'in the restaurant hospitality' business as owners).. This is not Mr Ramsay's problem because it's my understanding he would never allow\/tolerate such awful food or cold food to be served... It all looked great and presented well, and the only thing anyone agreed was delicious were the Caesar salad and the grilled shrimp appetizers. Even the desserts were really bad.. Salty toffee pudding?? REALLY??( someone at the table is from the UK and couldn't believe how bad the toffee pudding was!)  and a sliver of cheesecake that was a sin to even serve to anyone.. The pineapple dessert was creative .  The bottle of wine was delicious.\n\nSo, diners beware.. And know that it is OK to speak up if you aren't happy.. Just because this is some sort of TV show restaurant doesn't mean you cannot say you do not like something or it tastes weird or is cold... I felt bad for the other diners who looked at us with respect for saying something and wishing that they, too, had spoken.","date":"2018-10-13 19:20:15"}

It was a definite plus to have the Open Table option where we landed an early dinner 415p spot.  There did not appear to be a bad spot for a table.  Our experience walking in was as if we began a scene on Chef Ramsay's show.  To see the kitchen and the chefs' red\/white bandanas made it so real!  Alongside the cozy ambiance, service is top-notch!  Many sweet kudos to Sam; she totally rocked positive energy and charisma while delivering thorough knowledge about the restaurant.  She is a super example for top-notch customer service!\n\nWhile the food is not quite Michelin-worthy, it does not lack on taste and presentation.  After having what I considered one of the best made Beef Wellington at Chef Ramsey's pub, we couldn't resist another order seeing it on this menu.  We also ordered the Shigoku oysters (one of my fav) and the bone marrow apps.  The bone marrow was accompanied with short rib marmelade and toast.  \n\nAfter dinner my eyes just about popped out when Sam asked if we'd like to meet Season 17 winner Michelle Tribble.  Before I knew it, Miss Tribble walked up to our table.  She was ultra sweet and made time to get a couple of pics with us.  I asked the dumb question if she had a fav dish to cook.  But I was more excited of already knowing she won after coming in second place in Season 14.  Thank you Sam for a dream opportunity to meet this young chef!!","date":"2018-11-11 08:01:21"}

BUT . . . The food was very flavorful but it was the service slowness that must have caused the food to be served lukewarm. We arrived on time for our reservations but still had to wait 15 minutes before being seated (this being a hot spot, not unexpected). But then we waited for another 15 minutes at our table before someone finally came up & handed us menus and said our server would there soon. (No, not even any water yet!). Server arrives 5 minutes later. Very personable & polite. We ordered the Prix Fixe menu. They brought both of us the scallops instead of 1 scallop & 1 Caesar Salad. Said they would fix the salad and that took 20 minutes for the correction.  Eventually we got our Beef Wellington & while tasty & cooked correctly, it was lukewarm (as was the lobster risotto). Meanwhile we have noticed 4 other parties who were seated after us that had been served, eaten & paid while we were still waiting for the dessert portion (nothing else to do while waiting but look around). After awhile, we had to flag down our server to tell him to skip dessert because we had a show to get to & it was coming up on 7:00 (we'd been there since 4:45).  So we missed dessert because of the slowness but no offer of compensation for the delayed mix up on the salad or dessert. Also the noise level was off the hook. Couldn't hear across the table. There are better Gordon Ramsey restaurants in Vegas to go to.","date":"2018-11-10 19:05:30"}

They started us with an amuse bouche  that I can't recall what it was. Just ok nothing special. \n\nSoup: silky & decadent \n\nRisotto: with sage & butternut squash you can't go wrong. Delicious! Definitely an appetizer size portion, literally just a few bites of risotto. I really wish it was offered as an entree instead of an appetizer. \n\nShort ribs: served with some Brussel sprouts , pearl onion, tomatoes & polenta. Very good \n\nBrussel sprouts: roasted & topped with chilies and I'm pretty sure some type of soy sauce. Good but would have liked a little more heat from the chilies and after eating a few they got a little salty. The  portion was much larger than the risotto. Easily shareable. \n\nOverall we enjoyed our dinner.

I'm a huge Hell's Kitchen fan, so I'm already coming in a bit biased, BUT this place exceeded all my high expectations. Just remember to make a reservation at least a month in advance!!! \n\nI highly recommend the $69 three course meal which comes with a choice of caesar salad or scallops, beef wellington, and sticky toffee pudding. If you are dining with a partner, I recommend only one person getting the fixed price meal since the entree and dessert are the same. The other can order a different appetizer and entree, that way more delicious foods can be tasted! The dessert can definitely be shared since it's a rather large portion. I did the three course meal while my boyfriend ordered the 18 day aged New York strip along with some brussels sprouts. If you're into beer, the Hell's Kitchen IPA from Stone Brewing is  great!\n\nScallops (5\/5)\nThey were delicious! The scallops were sweet, perfectly cooked,  and paired with an amazing BBQ like sauce. One of the best scallop dishes I have ever had!\n\nBeef Welllington (4\/5)\nWhen at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, beef wellington is a must! I've never had it before, so I was really excited to finally try it. It was buttery, flaky and melt in your mouth.\n\n18 Day Dry Aged New York (5\/5)\nNeither of us has tried dry aged beef before and it was everything we thought it would be. The beef had such a strong flavor that is quite indescribable. If I had to pick between the wellington and the dry aged steak, I would pick the steak! \n\nBrussels Sprouts (5\/5)\nWhat a game changer! We couldn't decide which side to get, and our waiter recommended the brussels sprouts and I am so glad he did. Hands down the best brussels sprouts ever! Do yourself a favor and order them!\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding (5\/5)\nI'm not a sweets person and this was great!! 100% recommend ending your meal with this. The ice cream paired with the warm cake is amazing.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing experience and it became even better when Christina, Michelle, and Gordon were all there. All three were super friendly and took pictures with fans. Gordon stood there and took pictures with fans for about 20 minutes. It was quite chaotic when he walked into the restaurant, but meeting him was definitely a highlight of my trip. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to dine here again!","date":"2018-02-18 23:44:04"}

Pan seared scallops were good, but I expected the risotto to be more creamy and savory. Oysters were also good but we only got them because we were craving. I would suggest trying another appetizer. Now the beef Wellington, wow... My first time having the dish but I can't imagine it any other way: flaky crust with a perfectly cooked, tender, piece of meat inside. Delicious!

We opted for lunch and already knew what we were going to order before we walked through the doors.  \n\nAll you need to know for your first experience at Hell's Kitchen is the 3 course lunch menu.  Seriously, this is prob my favorite commercialized spot in Vegas at this point in time.  Cmon...what do they always cook on every single episode of Hell's Kitchen?  Beef wellington, of course!!!  \n\nFirst though, you get a choice between caesar salad or white asparagus soup.  I was able to try both and have zero complaints.  Beef wellington...DELISH.  Perfectly cooked, served with delicious garnishes...I could taste every single ingredient.  It was everything I thought it would be.  Lastly, the sticky toffee pudding.  This dessert is huge...and probably one of the best, if not the best sticky toffee pudding I have ever had.\n\nOur server also had a fantastic personality and kept the meal lighthearted.  At the end, we asked if we could take a photo with Michelle, head chef and last season's winner.  She was extremely gracious and took the time to take photos with anyone who asked.  Super down to earth and just really nice.  \n\nI highly recommend this spot if you're looking for good food and if you're a fan of the show.","date":"2018-06-03 06:49:01"}

This was my second visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas (my first was Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse) and I was pretty excited when my foodie friend, Jeremy, suggested going to Hell's Kitchen when we were in Vegas for a night before heading to Arizona the following morning. I was all in and eager to bite into another Beef Wellington. \n\nLuckily Jeremy made the reservation months in advance for us (party of three) because as we stood waiting for our table to be ready, I overheard the hostesses turning people away; \"reservations only.\" Although I was getting frustrated with the wait (we did have reservations after all), it was worth it when we were lead to our table overlooking the fountains. It was a much quieter part of the restaurant and I truly appreciated that. \n\nOur waiter was knowledgeable and when I asked if he recommended the tuna tartare or the lobster risotto, he was quick to recommend the risotto and holy cow, I'm glad he did. I really wish I could just bathe in the lobster risotto for the rest of my life - it was SO good. The Beef Wellington was comparable to the wellington at the steakhouse; delicious. I was so happy that I was pretty full and able to take my leftovers to savor the following day. \n\nAll in all, sure it's pretty pricey but it's an experience and because of that, it's worth it. I should mention that one of the previous show winners was at the restaurant the evening we were there. I don't watch the show and I didn't know who she was... so it was fairly awkward... but if you're a fan of the show, it would've been great!

We made our reservation three weeks in advance and still couldn't secure a decent dinner time so we settled with what we could get: 4:45 PM. It was a little early but oh well! More time to digest our food afterwards! We did get there a tiny bit late, about five minutes, and it was a-okay. No issues. We did call to let them know as well and they were very accommodating.\n\nMy husband and I decided to share:\n\nNotes From Gordon: Plymouth dry gin, green tea, lemongrass, peach, lemon, and a message from Gordon. The presentation is really nice for this cocktail because of the note. It's kind of \"cute.\" As for the taste, I can't say that it was my favorite. It had a nice fresh and light front, almost like sprite and vodka. However, as soon as that left, it tasted like cough syrup and that could be due to the gin. \n\nLobster Risotto: Butter poached lobster tail, saffron risotto, and tomato confit. Delicious, delicious, delicious. I thought it was going to be a huge portion but it wasn't, which is good! Because huge portions of risotto means it gets way too heavy. Hell's Kitchen's serving size is perfect! \n\nHeirloom Tomato Burrata Salad: Heirloom tomatoes, white balsamic reduction, olive oil, crystalized basil, and thai basil mix. Very refreshing. The heirloom tomatoes were a little sweet and the crystalized basil added an interesting texture to the mix. We had this after the risotto and I think it was perfect timing.\n\nBeef Wellington: Potato puree, glazed root vegetables, and red wine demi-glace. My husband got this dish and he loved it. He finished the whole thing! They use filet mignon for their choice of meat. The puff pastry was done super well. \n\nRoasted Rack of Lamb: Vadouvan carrots, bloomsdale spinach, and harissa lamb jus. This was my entree and I loved every bit of it. They use Colorado lamb versus New Zealand lamb for this. Colorado lamb is meatier and less gamy than New Zealand lamb. I actually don't mind the gaminess from lamb so it wasn't a point of concern. Colorado rack of lamb is definitely larger in size and despite it being meatier, it was still very tender. Their cooking method is also the reason why it would be tender. The whole rack is cooked before slicing -- they may sear it and finish it in the oven, keeping a tight control on the temperature. I wanted medium rare and that is exactly what I got!\n\nWild Mushroom Side: Ehhhh. It was good but definitely didn't add to the meal. It's one of those things where if we have it cool, if we don't cool. \n\nFor dessert, we got their sticky toffee pudding. It came with a scoop speculoos ice cream on top. It was delicious and diabetic sweet. I'm not a huge sweets fan but I couldn't stop eating this pudding! The mixture of hot and cold was great but you know what would be better? A glass of milk with it. \n\nI can't say that I am an avid Gordon Ramsey fan. I don't follow his shows religiously but I have watched snippets here and there. I also see a lot of his memes online. I have also seen some of his quick youtube videos on how to make simple yet delicious meals. I honestly believe that Hell's Kitchen is definitely a good place to dine in. Their prices are fairly reasonable and the portions are perfect. The service was great. The server even had them add a candle to our dessert to celebrate our anniversary! \n\nIf you don't have reservations, you could probably grab a seat at the bar or high tops. You could literally just walk in, have dessert and leave! \n\nI definitely wouldn't mind coming again. I have been dreaming about their Lobster Risotto since.","date":"2018-09-11 06:49:31"}

Check out was 11:00 so we decided 11:30 should be good. And what do you know we called and they said 11:30 for 3 people was actually the only slot they had available. We were even late 15 minutes but we called beforehand to inform them and they said they would hold the table. \n\nWe checked in and the atmosphere was absolutely welcoming. Big windows to allow the sunlight in and had a fountain view where we sat. They even showed a red and blue team through an open kitchen!! Felt like I was in the show. No experience like it. \n\nWe ordered the Lobster Risotto to start and I asked for a Cucumber Southside. The waitress and bartender were so kind as the drink wasn't really on their menu, but they googled it and made it for me. What an amazing service. Our server also made sure to check on us more than twice. (Way more than a usual restaurant in my opinion.)\n\nThe Lobster Risotto was 5* off the bat. Amazing taste, blissful crunch, and then this gorgeous aftertaste that I unfortunately can't describe well enough with my vocabulary.\n\nI do regret that we ordered simple dishes for our entrees (2 filet mignons and a NY strip) as it did feel that way when we ate the dish.

I'm not sure why they had sports on, we were there to immerse ourselves in the Hell's Kitchen experience, not have a sports program blaring at you.

There were 2 problems though, the first is they were luke warm when they arrived and cold by the time I got to the last one, the second was everyone found shells in their scallops.  My husband had one so large he had to discreetly spit it out.\n\nThe next course was the beef wellington.  That too looked incredible when it came out.  The puff pastry was crisp and the beef melted in your mouth.  The potatoes and veggies it came with were bland, we looked around for salt and pepper shakers and didn't see any, we assumed it is because Chef Ramsay is big on having food seasoned properly before it leaves the kitchen, they missed the mark on that.\n\nLastly came the sticky toffee pudding.  Let me just say at this point no one is sure how we're going to eat dessert, but when it arrived, it looked and smelled delicious.  It was warm, gooey and tasted like an ultra moist spice cake, only better!  The speculoos ice cream it came with went perfectly with the pudding.  Unfortunately at this point, we were too full to finish it.\n\nOne thing I had noticed reading the reviews, people who were celebrating special events were offered a free dessert, because we ordered off the pre fixe menu, that wasn't possible, it would have been nice to have been offered a glass of wine instead.\n\nAs we were eating dinner, we noticed Chef Michelle greeting different tables and taking pictures.  She had gone back in the kitchen when we were getting ready to leave and we asked our waiter if she could take a picture with us.  When she came to the table she was defensive and short with us.  We started to say we were fans and had watched her last year, but she didn't seem interested and asked if we had a problem or complaint?  We were taken aback and became tongue tied.  I'm not sure what our waiter told her, we didn't complain to him about the scallops or the unseasoned vegetables, so I'm not sure why she thought there was a problem.  Needless to say, we did get our picture taken with her, but it was extremely awkward.  So much so that we cancelled our reservations we had previously made at Ramsays Grill.  If a customer has a complaint, coming at them like that won't make things better.\n\nWe're still big fans of Gordon Ramsay and we are extremely glad we ate at Hell's Kitchen.  The food was truly delicious and it was a once in a lifetime experience for us, although for what it cost, I would rather have had a quieter atmosphere and a much better experience with the back of house staff.","date":"2018-10-26 19:56:32"}

Being a fan of the show, it wasn't necessarily what I was expecting, but I wasn't necessarily disappointed either. \n\n3\/5 for host service. With four hostesses on the floor for a lunch service, I felt the check in process was a little awkward and passive. Our request for a window table, or at least table in the room overlooking the strip was not accommodated, which was disappointing on top of the fact that we waited roughly an additional 10 mins past our reservation time. When our name was called we could barely hear the hostess because she wouldn't elevate her voice in a crowded lobby. I maybe understood a quarter of what she said as she walked us to the table highlighting features of the restaurant because she was facing away from us and speaking towards the loud, full dining room. Not a great first impression. \n\nAs the host\/hostess, lobby and facility appearance\/upkeep loosely falls under your job in my opinion. When I went to the restroom, the floors were wet and both trash bins were overflowed with trash on the ground. Cleanliness wise, it was on par with fast food restrooms. While it may not be directly their job to correct it, I would think the host staff would make a point to check more frequently. I did inform the hostesses and they did seem concerned so hopefully it was just a one time slip up. \n\n6\/5 for dining room service. Our server, Dion, was wonderful. Much more informative on the restaurant and menu recommendations. His perfect service acumen is one thing; I would expect that from any server in the restaurant, but his warmth and passion for his role in the guest experience is exemplary. He was so understanding and helpful when I had to step away from the table, then genuinely followed up with me after returning. He made a point to connect with us on a personal level and you could tell he values his guests.\n\n5\/5 for food and drinks. I mean, did you expect anything else from a Ramsay establishment? Since it was lunch, we went simple with burgers and they were amazing. I had the spicy burger; it had just the right heat level to keep any spice lover diving back in for another bite without being overwhelming. The fries are also beyond reproach. Perfect size, perfect crispness, perfect seasoning. The menu features several of the offerings from the original restaurant. I will definitely be back to try the lobster risotto! \n\nAfter a long party weekend, I didn't sample any of the cocktails but did have their fresh brewed iced tea served with house made agave syrup on the side to flavor to your taste- a very nice detail which speaks to the quality of everything produced in the bar or kitchen. \n\n4\/5 for ambiance. It is a unique dining room, obviously designed to show off the kitchen, but the view is pretty obstructed unless you're sitting at the front tables. The space is bright, clean, and masculine. The seating was also very nice and comfortable. The only negative is it's very loud and has terrible acoustics which is what unfortunately left the biggest impression.","date":"2018-02-28 14:53:44"}

Just perfect with my paired white wine.\n\nBeef Wellington - Cooked to perfection!  I typically don't like my meats cooked this way, but, it was amazing and worth every bite!  Perfect size and packs tons of flavor.  A perfect match with the Cabernet served.\n \nSticky Toffee Pudding with speculoos ice cream- decadent and rich.  A great way to ending a delicious meal!  Paired of course with this great Fonseca Porto, aged Tawny port 10 years.  \n\nThis could not get any better!  The service was top notch.

The dessert was pretty tasty.\n\nOutside of the 3 course meal, we also got the lobster risotto appey and also short rib dish as the 2nd entree.  The risotto was my favorite of this entire meal.

I had the Caesar Salad for the appetizer and it was the best dish for the entire meal! I love the large portion and the handmade croutons and baked cheese. It was quite delicious for just a salad. I was expecting all of Gordon's Ramsay's dishes to be just like this one. I also ordered the Pan Seared Scallops. This dish was cold when it came to my table and there was TOO MUCH peas on it. The pea paste that was below the scallop piece overpowered the scallop, since it taste like I was eating bland baby food. \n\nThe Beef Wellington was a disappointment. It was SO BLAND. Everyone at my table agreed they could've at least seasoned the steak with salt and pepper. There was such a thin puff pastry layer that was not flaky or crispy at all when I had my first bite. It was quite soggy. It would be better off ordering just the steak by itself without the puff pastry around it. I would have enjoyed that better because of the butter knives the restaurant gives you. I mean steak is suppose to be cooked right so you can cut it like butter, but come on why are there still BUTTER KNIVES USED AS STEAK KNIVES. I had a hard time cutting through that cold thick slab of meat with a butter knife. Come on, Gordon Ramsay! Can't you afford steak knives for everyone??? The whole entire dish was cold when it came to me. I guess they want to present all the entrees at once for each table, but that made all the dishes cold by the time it got to you. \n\nThe dessert was Sticky Toffee Pudding with a scoop of Speculoos Cookie Butter Ice Cream on top. I like the large portion they give you because most places give you tiny desserts. I'm a big fan of cookie butter, so I loved the ice cream! I wish they gave me ice cream then since a small scoop. The Sticky Toffee Pudding taste good like every other one I've had before. \n\nI had the drink Rum Donkey which is their version of a Moscow Mule. It was delicious and it was cool how they had a little shell on top of the drink to light a flame. I like the cup that it was served in also. \n\nService was alright here.

I ordered all of Gordon's essential Hell's Kitchen dishes: the scallops, the beef wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding.\n\nAll of these were exactly what I was hoping for. The beef wellington, in particular, is a must-try here. I can't imagine going to Hell's Kitchen and ordering any other entree, honestly. The beef was cooked perfectly, and it was moist and tender. The pastry shell was browned, and the duxelles  added a great flavor. It was so good.\n\nAnd do I need to even write about the scallops and pudding? Absolutely  great. It's not a true Michelin Star restaurant by any means, but the food is definitely up to Gordon Ramsay's standards. I also got to meet the head chef, who won Hell's Kitchen All Stars.

Delicious foodporn worthy food . Beautiful space. Well done. 4.5 stars \n\nPretty easy to find since it's a standalone restaurant right on the strip in front of Caesars Palace. Arrived around noontime and there were plenty of seats at the bar which later filled up. Pretty much everywhere in Vegas hospitality\/service is on point and this was right up there. I don't watch the show and I appreciated my bartender recommending their signature dishes. \n\nLOBSTER RISOTTO $25 -  Perfection. The butter poached lobster was flavorful and fresh, pretty generous portion too. I liked how it was precut into bite sized pieces. The risotto was rich and creamy, with crispy onions providing some texture. MUST ORDER. (10\/10)\n\nPAN SEARED SCALLOPS $24 - Had the surf and turf going on with the soft bacon lardons. The sweet corn puree brought sweetness. Great coloring on the scallops, if there was harder sear for texture or something crisp to contrast the softness, this could be a perfectly balanced dish. (8.5\/10) \n\nPINEAPPLE CARPACCIO $11 - w\/ citrus foam, coconut sorbet, coriander, passionfruit. Spectacular with the dry ice presentation. The people next to me both took pics\/vids of my dessert. (8\/10)\n\nMEET YOUR MAKER - $14 - Maker's, Domaine de Canton (ginger liquer), mint, apple, strawberry, cinnamon. Well done.

My wife and I came here for our anniversary.  We went all out in what we ordered, as it was a celebration and we are huge Gordon Ramsey fans!  \n\nWe started with some nice wine and then worked our way into the seafood tower for our appetizer.  Wow, it was awesome, as the waiter lead us to believe!  Btw, our service was very good, and we tipped appropriately.  As for the seafood tower, it included lobster, king crab, jumbo shrimp, fresh oysters and clams, then served with a couple nice sauces for dipping.  It really was good, but pricey, $100 just for the appetizer, but well worth it if you are celebrating.  \n\nAs for our dinners, my wife had the chicken breast with roasted vegetables and served with a nice brown sauce; sorry I don't remember the details, but it was good.  I had the signature Filet Wellington that Gordon is famous for, plus I added the fresh shaved black truffles that our waiter suggested.  I was so excited for my dish, but it did come out cold.  I was hesitant on saying anything, as we were really enjoying our evening.  I did finally speak up, as the dish just wasn't right.  The waiter was attentive, then he took my plate to the kitchen to make me a new one.  About 15 minutes later they came back out with the same Wellington that was now warm, but over cooked, bummer...  Remember this is a $50 dinner, plus $28 for the shaved truffles on top.  I did expect it to be remade.  I didn't complain again, as I didn't want to wreck our evening.  \n\nAt the end of the dinner, Joanna, one of the managers came to our table to ask about our meal.  She specifically asked about how I liked the Wellington?  I told her nicely, that it still wasn't right...  she blew off my comment, rolled her eyes, then proceeded to walk away.  It was handled very poorly by management!  I said nothing, tipped our waiter very well, but felt let down on how the situation was handled.  It made me feel like they only wanted my money, which I dropped $400 for two to have dinner.  In my book, this makes us a pretty good customer, but we didn't feel that way when we walked out.  \n\nOh yeh, the toffee pudding cake for dessert was awesome as well!","date":"2018-07-25 14:07:07"}

It was a great drink with a smoky liquor and a few fresh juices to balance out the flavor. I'd definitely order this again. For food we started with Scallops and a Caesar Salad. Both were some of the best I've ever had. The scallops were perfectly prepared with a delicious sauce that paired well. The Caesar Salad was a large portion with the best flavor. The cheese on the salad had a bold flavor that really kicked the flavor up a notch without overpowering the other flavors.\n\nFor the main course we shared the signature Beef Wellington and the Crispy Skin Salmon. The Beef Wellington lived up to the hype, perfectly tender meat and a delicious pastry on the outside. The potato puree and sauce were amazing as well. The Crispy Skin Salmon was also perfectly prepared. The skin was definitely the highlight, somehow perfectly crispy without being overcooked. The salmon also came with a delicious sauce and side of lentils that I enjoyed. \n\nIt was only fitting that we ended the meal with the Sticky Toffee Pudding. This also lived up to the hype for me.

I asked for medium rare and it came out super rare without sauce (due to them thinking and not sure if there was bell pepper in the sauce- I have an intolerance). I did ask for the sauce and had it- all is well obviously. The only thing I can think of is that if they put the sauce on it it would have looked more medium rare than rare itself.

Next time I will send it back or have it be adjusted but considering I eat the slowest out of the group and didn't have the patience for it to be re-done I did not say anything but was not asked about it either.

The food is fantastic. In fact, they already raised the prix fix dinner $3 to $72. However, the service, while friendly, is off timing-wise. We had to wait 20 minutes for water and a glass of sparkling wine. They did apologize and it was a Saturday night, but it's apparent they are a tad short staffed.\n\nFortunately we had a reservation and I think that got us a table in a quieter section of the restaurant because it's definitely loud with music pounding. This is not the place to go for a romantic dinner in Vegas...more of a party atmosphere to go with friends. \n\nI did the prix fix three courses and chose the scallops with the beef wellington. I had tried the wellington at Gordon's restaurant in Paris and it had disappointed. I wanted to give it another chance based on the rave reviews. I must say, this filet was superior. It was a large portion expertly prepared and melted in your mouth. I have decided that I don't really need my beef wrapped in pastry. It's just added calories and probably just isn't my thing. I ordered it though for the mushrooms which I do love. \n\nExecutive Chef Michelle Tribble was the winner of HK and we dined during her 2nd official shift according to our server. Her win seems well deserved. For appetizers we tried the famous scallops and they were delicious. The caesar salad was just how I like it prepared...anchovies, lemon and parmesan in a light mayo style dressing. \n\nBut the absolute star of the show were the lamb chops in a light curry sauce. I am not generally a lamb fan but I wanted to grab my husband's chops and gnaw them to the bone!!! Sticky toffee pudding was also fabulous.

After you eat his food, you think, \"Hey, maybe...just maybe, those people deserved those mental breakdowns.\" \n\nThe restaurant is like a Hell's Kitchen theme park. They've got the trademark HK sign that's on fire. There's a life-sized portrait of Gordon Ramsay talking to you. There's a hallway with his face staring menacingly, as if you've just been eliminated from a high-stakes competition. TVs playing HK highlights on repeat. And of course, merch, merch, merch! \n\nBut as silly as all of this is, it's definitely got the trademark Gordon swagger. Every detail is perfect, from the beautiful red hostess dresses, to the mini pitchfork ceiling decor. The service was absolutely impeccable and we were waited on by not one, but two amazing servers. Keeping your water filled was just the minimum; they were quick, efficient, and wonderful conversationalists. \n\nNow, the food. Absolutely exquisite. It's pricey, but the quality AND quantity were great value in my opinion. The $72 Beef Wellington prix fixe is a must-order. It comes with either salad or scallops (definitely get the scallops), the Wellington (originally $59 so the prix fixe is a steal), and sticky toffee pudding. Between 3 people, we got that, plus another order of scallops, a foie gras app, lobster risotto, lamb, and a side of potato gratin. \n\nEverything tasted as good as it looked. It was an absolute dream. From the pea puree at the bottom of the perfect scallops, to the last drop of smoky caramel in the toffee pudding. The foie gras was seared, fatty goodness. The lobster tasted like it was just in the ocean that morning. The lamb came in, surprisingly, 3 beautiful large pieces, which again, is really quite a good value. I can't even pick a favourite. Everything was memorable. Even the potato gratin side dish kept me going back. \n\nGuys, that angry British man knows what he's yelling about. You're not going to have anyone screaming \"IT'S RAWWW!\" here. Get your butt into that restaurant and experience a TV gimmick at its finest. \n\n(42\/100) - 2018","date":"2018-06-06 16:40:43"}

Skeptical to order the same things, we all tried something new. My father in law got the short rib, my mother in law got the seafood appetizer, my wife got the crispy skin salmon and a casear salad, and I got the Steak and decided to give the fries another shot. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Special Brew from Stone and it was awesome. The short rib was perfect. So flavorful and tender it just melt in your mouth. My father in law was blown away. I don't like seafood so I didn't try my mother in law seafood tower but she was so impressed. She said it was some of the best seafood shes had in Vegas. Flavor and freshness was key. My wife loved her crispy skin salmon. The other things that went with it, really rounded out the meal and balanced the fish. I did take a bite of it and it was really good. Just a bit fishy for me, but I didn't order it. My steak was perfect. I asked for well done and got it the way I wanted. It had nice crisp outside, yet juicy inside. Seasoned perfectly. The demi glaze and wild mushrooms were incredible. The fries did come out crispy but yet again, no seasoning. Maybe they might need a new recipe for their fries. They do seem like maybe they are frozen fries. The busser did run quickly to get me salt and ketchup. Something that I didn't get last visit. Other then the fries, the food was so much better. It was the quality and taste we were hoping for the 1st visit. We ended the meal with 2 desserts to share. The famous toffee pudding with speculous ice cream and the chocolate raspberry mousse torte.

Waited months to get in here, got to say was a little disappointed it was not set up a little nicer, it was more bar in the front part and very loud, so loud you could not hear music and clearly it becomes a meat market later on.\n\nI ordered the Lobster Rissoto which was absolutely delicious, and the wellington. My boyfriend ordered the fixed menu selecting the scallops, also very good tho I think the risotto was better. The wellington was a good cut of beef very tender but it was not filet minion, I was a bit disappointed, I have watched a lot of shows and even Gordon says filet, but this was not, not sure why we would cut corners on a 50$ entrée, my potato's were ice cold, that being said I gave it a 4.  two dinners and two glasses of wine and it was 232$, not the most expensive meal I have had but also not the best.\n\nWe will go back after it settles down some and give it one more time because I want to love it.\n\nI will say the service was exceptional!","date":"2018-07-04 23:02:11"}

Our servers were Marina and her assistant, Jose. We both ordered the prix fixe meal with scallops, beef wellington and sticky toffee pudding. \n\nEverything was beautifully presented and served on hot plates. Hubby got iced tea and I got a cocktail Notes From Gordon. The cocktail tasted amazing!!! It was sweet, easy to drink and refreshing.\n\nI am not a seafood person at all, but, when I bit into the scallops it had a smokey bacon flavor. It was absolutely delicious. All beef wellingtons are served medium rare. I like my meat medium well and to my surprise I really enjoyed my medium rare beef wellington, it was delicious and very tender. The sticky toffee pudding is a generous size and served with a scoop of ice cream. I tasted the cake by itself before I tried it with the ice cream and actually liked it better without the ice cream. Thanks to Jose our drinks never went empty and our table was always clean and we never felt rushed.  Marina's and Jose's service were impeccable!!\n\nI had gone to the men's room and when I went to wash my hands my finger was pierced by something sharp. I noticed there was a piece of metal falling off the sink. I took a picture of it to bring it to someone's attention. I saw Executive Chef Michelle Tribble walking by (Season 17 winner of Hell's Kitchen). I got her attention,  she came over to our table, I explained to her the sink issue and showed her the pic. She was thankful and would take care of it.  Two minutes later Marina, Michelle and Danny (Manager) were all at our table.  Danny was very thankful for bringing it to their attention and would take care of it immediately.\n\nEveryone was very professional, nice and friendly. Michelle is super sweet and friendly. She allowed me to take selfies with her and let Danny take pics of George, myself and her together. Hell's Kitchen and Michelle was the best way to wrap up our Vegas vacation. We will definitely be back on our next trip. \n\nThank you Chef Ramsay for allowing us a taste of Heaven.","date":"2018-10-26 02:46:36"}

We both order the prix menu which includes seared scallops or Caesar salad, beef Wellington and a sticky toffee pudding. We also ordered lobster risotto for and appetizer and sides of Mac and cheese and wild mushrooms. First the risotto was amazing!! I'm not a huge lobster fan but I could eat this all day. My husband enjoyed his scallops while I had the Caesar salad which was disappointing. Not enough dressing, lemon juice was on it, and croutons were way too hard. Also no salt or pepper at the table. The Wellington was the most tender beef I have ever had but lacked a little in flavor, the red wine reduction made up for that as long as you had enough. The veggies were blah and potatoes purée was bland. Mac and cheese was yummy but alas Mac and cheese, the wild mushrooms were under seasoned and slimy. By far the best part of the meal was dessert. The sticky toffee pudding. Oh my word it was heavenly! As for the prices I'd say you're paying for the HK and Gordon Ramsey name. I wouldn't pay that much for the food on a normal bases.

But to be brutally honest, our meal here was probably one of the best meals I've ever had so I just have to leave my two cents. Located outside of Cesar's Palace, you'll find that Hell's Kitchen is quite large and elegant. The decor is simple, modern, and beautifully designed. The open kitchen seems to be the main attraction where you can see the chefs carefully crafting and cooking. \n\nFrom appetizer to dessert, everything we had was delicious. For starter, we were given a small watermelon appetizer which was topped with goat cheese and black pepper. The mac and cheese featured smoked gouda and prosciutto. The topping with bread crumbs added an excellent texture. \n\nWe ordered the fixed menu to get the most bang for or buck, which included an appetizer (scallops or Cesar salad), the famous beef wellington, and a dessert (toffee cake with cookie butter icecream). The scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn puree was very light. The beef wellington was cooked to a medium rare. SO TENDER. SO SOFT. The outer breading was delicious- buttery and flakey! The toffee cake was outstanding. The portion size was quite large so it could easily be shared between 2-3 people. The cake itself was so moist, spongey, and buttery. Each bite was heaven. The toffee flavor wasn't as prominent as I thought it would be. It tasted more like a butter cake... and if you're in the city of Sin, this feels no less sinful. The cold icecream paired well with its warmth. I am SO glad we order the fix menu and got to try out all of the dishes. \n\nWith all the food, we left uncomfortably full. I can't remember the last time I've eaten that much food. Despite the crazy steep prices on the menu, all of the food was crafted to perfection and the experience was amazing. Our waitress Sandra answered all our questions and made suggestions. She was really friendly and checked on us frequently. The price for 1 side, 1 entree, 2 alcoholic drinks, and one prefixed menu course added up to about $206 for the both of us. It was truly a once in a lifetime experience so the value was definitely worth it. The portion sizes are surprisingly large. Both of our entrees was more than enough food for us plus the side dish. Presentation could not have been better. \n\nHell's Kitchen is a MUST if you are a Gordon Ramsey fan or even if you're looking for an elegant dinner experience in Las Vegas. Definitely try the beef wellington- you won't regret it!","date":"2018-09-15 23:59:56"}

We had a 6PM reservation on 2\/17 and were excited to eat here before our Elton John show. We are huge fans of the show and the proximity to the venue made this the perfect choice. \n\nUpon arrival we had to wait 40 mins. I even arrived 30 minutes early and was told not to bother waiting and to come back at 6. I'm a Diamond member and typically get speedy service for Total Rewards restaurants but considering this place had only been open for a month I waited patiently. \n\nWhen we were finally seated we were sat in some back area with no view of the kitchen. We were put at some huge wobbly table for 8 even though we were a party of 3. It was so awkward with our party so far apart from each other with the wobbly ass table and no view of hella kitchen. I could have order take out and had the same experience. \n\nOur server then tells us based on the time we were seated and the time we had to go to the concert that we wouldn't have time for appetizers and entrees, basically pick one or the other. We ordered 2 filets, and a New York with some potato's au gratin. They were cooked perfectly but not any better than BLT at Bally's which provides a far superior service and experience for their diners. \n\nBased on how Gordon says service should be on all his shows we were left very disappointed and thinking that Gordon talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk.

Britney, the server, was outstanding.  She was prompt, personable, and professional.  The scallops, lobster risotto, and waygu meatball apps were great.  My Caesar salad had a bit too much lemon juice, but not bad.  The NY strip, Caesar salad with shrimp, rack of lamb, and filet entrees were all excellent as well.  The beef wellington was a bit bland.  The one problem was the red quinoa salad, which we believe may have been bad, as my wife was sick all night, and she alone ate that item. Bring your wallet, just a bit pricey.  Also, why is there no baby changing table in the restrooms?  Overall: nice place, don't get the quinoa.","date":"2018-06-08 02:04:26"}

The food was amazing, the service was superb (thanks George G!), and the strip view at night was fantastic.  I do love GR Burger, but this is more upscale with a higher end menu, yet somehow friendlier and less pretentious than the overpriced Pub & Grill (go figure).\n\nHell's Kitchen is located in the old stand-alone Serendipity building in front of Caesar's.   It's definitely touristy and busy, but we had a reservation, so we didn't have to wait.  Our dinner service flowed smoothly and even though they had a full house we were not rushed along.\n\nWhile we were deciding on dinner options, George brought us out some tasty Amuse-bouche with our cocktails.\n\nWe started with the Lobster Risotto $24 and Pumpkin Soup $12.  The risotto was cooked perfectly; rich and creamy, and the sweet lobster tail was a scrumptious addition.  The pumpkin soup was a surprise.  I ordered it on a whim, but it was absolutely delicious; sweet and savory with a little kick from the chorizo, and a bit of crunch from the pepitas.  It was delightful.\n \nFor entrees we went with the obligatory Beef Wellington $49 and Braised Short Rib $34.  The Short Rib was simply phenomenal.  So tender and bursting with flavor and paired nicely with polenta and veggies.  The Wellington was also delicious and cooked perfectly medium rare, but I'm not gonna lie, I would go back just for the Short Rib.  \n\nWe also ordered a side of Roasted Cauliflower $9; which was fun & different because it had a chili lime gremolata & mint in it.  But it was certainly necessary with all the other food we shared!\n\nI'll absolutely be returning to try other items from the menu.  Those wagyu meatballs and beet salad are definitely calling my name!  And the Short Rib Grilled Cheese...holy moly...damn now I'm hungry!","date":"2018-07-31 00:25:59"}

But the look and feel is more refined. Exposed kitchen included, so you can observe the chefs putting the dishes together. \n\nI was curious to try out HK since it gained so much popularity in the short time that it has been open. My friend and I came for lunch on a Thursday, so it wasn't too difficult to get a reservation. I was definitely eager to try out the beef Wellington, which is only available on the lunch menu as part of the 3-course menu. For dinner, it is available as an individual dish. If you do order the 3-course menu, they do not require the entire table to order it, which is a common practice at a lot of restaurants. Lucky for us, because my friend and I like variety and wanted to share a few different dishes.\n\n$25 Lobster Risotto w\/ butter poached lobster tail, truffle risotto, crispy onions:\nGreat! The hefty lobster tail was very tender and sweet in flavor. It sat on top of buttery, yellow risotto. \n\n$23 Hell's Kitchen Burger w\/ bacon, avocado, fresno pepper jam, crispy onion, ghost pepper jack cheese, seasoned fries:\nVery good! This was a very hefty burger with quite a bit going on. The beef patty was very substantial and juicy, with pretty good meat to bun ratio. The bun itself was quite fluffy, held its shape well, and was lightly toasted. The cheese was very nicely melted on top of the patty. All things that I look for in a good burger. I just was not quite sold on the mashed avocado and pepper jam mixing together.\n\n$62 for 3-course lunch \/ $75 for dinner (not a bad bundle price, considering the beef Wellington itself is $57 for dinner)\n\nWhite Asparagus Soup w\/ shaved asparagus salad, phyllo-parmesan crisp: \nVery good! The soup mostly consists of creamy puree, and who doesn't like a nice cheese crisp?\n\nBeef Wellington w\/ potato puree, glazed root vegetables, red wine demi-glace:\nExcellent! The beef was pretty spot-on for medium rare. The inside had a nice pink center, whereas the outer layers were cooked well. It had a good amount of springiness to it, while it was wrapped in buttery, flaky pastry. Plus, the red wine demi-glace was not too overpowering.\nSome more vegetables would have been nice since there was only 1 carrot and 1 radish on the plate. And... isn't potato puree pretty much just mashed potato?\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding w\/ speculoos ice cream:\nGood! If you plan to order this, it may be best to share it. This is yet another hefty portion. Luckily for me, my friend did a very good job eating her fair share, since I was starting to feel the weight of all the food. Plus the sticky toffee pudding was a little too sweet for me. To me, it most resembles a heavy cake drenched in syrup. The speculoos ice cream was ok, but the coldness helped to break up the heavy sweetness.\n\nIf I had room for one more dish, I probably would have ordered the scallops. In short, HK serves quality classic dishes, and the service was very good too.","date":"2018-10-31 09:44:06"}

They mixed up our orders with the table across from us. Without being said, my boyfriend switched his order of mignon to the NY Strip I had. Once they brought us our \"medium\" steaks it was still ridiculously dry. Then after tasting the steak.. we dipped our tongue into the potato purée which looked extremely creamy and heavenly.... but guess what?! There was a piece of plastic found inside of our dish! The waitress was extremely kind and gave us  ~50\/60% off for all the inconveniences that occurred.

Also, after seeing the risotto preparation being screwing up many times on the program, she was delighted with the taste and results.\n\nDerek took very good care of us and made this a very enjoyable experience.

Looking around, a previous chief (Robyn) of the Hell's Kitchen competition was sitting at the next table. After our meals, she stopped by our table to chat.\n\nSince I ordered the prefix menu, the entree of beef wellington was coming next.

Only thing that could have been better for that scene was seeing Gordon Ramsey yell at someone that they were a fat cow and forcing them to eat their failed dish. Lol. We ordered the scallops and beef Wellington which are signature items from the show Nd they did not disappoint. Corn purée was so tasty and scallops cooked perfectly. Beef was tender and melt in your mouth good. Oh can't forget the baked Mac and cheese with 3 cheeses which had bacon sprinkles on top. For dessert we had toffee sticky pudding which was really a cake with ice cream on top. Holy hell that was decadent! Felt like a celebrity.

It was paired with a light delicious wine. If you look at the pictures, the plate came without soup but was gorgeous and the server poured the hot soup into the bowl once we saw the presentation. Omgoshhhh did it taste delicious and the pepitas and sausage that was garnished, made the soup! I've never really had pumpkin soup but if it all tastes like that, sign me up for more. \n\nThe second course, Beef Wellington, to die for. If you watch the show you hear Gordon Ramsey yell about how he wants it cooked correctly, now I see why. The beef is wrapped in prosciutto them wrapped in pastry. That meat cut so easily and was so tender, it was amazing. The plate had potato purée and a few veggies and those were just as delicious with the demi-glacé. The wine pairing for this entree was delicious as well and I do not enjoy red wines.\n\nThe last course, the sticky toffee pudding, can I say holy crap? We were poured a glass of port wine to pair with this dessert and not a single person at the table was able to finish the desert. It was delicious and rich and everything I didn't think it would be. I really had no idea what toffee pudding would look or taste like that. Yumm! \n\nAll in all, the wine pairing was delicious and mixed well with the foods they suggested with it. The pours were not small in any way and the food was everything I expected and more. \n\nThumbs up to Hells Kitchen Las Vegas.","date":"2018-04-25 21:26:55"}

However, I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay's cooking so when the opportunity came for me to visit one of his restaurants, I could not resist. Thus, off to an early dinner with my mother and a sister-friend (SF). \n\nThe Restaurant: Well, on the Las Vegas Strip parking valet is the best option unless you walk from somewhere else close. This location is on the same property as Caesar's Palace yet it is outside of the massive hotel resort. That alone is a plus due to less walking. The foyer is spacious with portraits of past HK winners, merchandise for purchase, a talking avatar of Gordon himself, no seating and hot! We arrived early for our reservation so we had to wait about 15 minutes. My back was soaked with sweat. It was hotter outside so I could not win either way. Once we were seated, the inside is spacious, beautiful and comfortable. However, the windows are not tinted so we had to request the shades be drawn due to the sunbeams bouncing off the windows from the hotel resort across the street. There are no condiments on the tables. No sugar. No salt. No pepper. Most restaurants, dare I say all restaurants, have at least salt and pepper on each table. Not this one! I remember years ago hearing Gordon say that food should not need extras once it leaves the kitchen. Well - I'll get back to that. \n\nThe Service: The hostess was pretty polite considering we were early, it's Vegas and there were many people walking in requesting tables. Our waiter, Charlie had the greatest attitude, was very friendly and his sense of humor excelled. I'm pretty sure he was born to be in the service industry. If you are blessed, literally blessed to be placed at one of Charlie's tables, tip him graciously because he earned it. It's one thing to do your job. It's another when you go above and beyond your job just because you want to and that was my impression of Charlie, the waiter. The busboy and water filler (not sure of their actual titles) were so polite and patient. I saw no issues with the service from top to bottom, beginning to end. \n\nThe Food: I started the Scampi Prawns. They weren't as big as I am used to prawns being and there were a total of three. They were served in an oriental like hot plate causing the prawns to sizzle. It made me think of how fajitas are served yet this was much more sophisticated and elegant. I then moved to the NY strip steak with extra red wine demi-glace and potato gratin. The potato gratin had NO seasoning at all. I couldn't believe it. It was then I felt Gordon did not stand behind his word. Those potatoes NEEDED salt and pepper. It's like whoever prepared them figured the cheese would season the potatoes. WRONG! I was scared to ask for salt and pepper since they weren't on the table, so I added demi-glace and ate as much as I could. Even with the red wine demi-glace, the potato gratin still needed salt and pepper. Mom started with the white asparagus soup and then moved to the roasted rack of lamb. She loved the soup. They offered cracked pepper and she said it tasted better with the pepper. SF had the Beef Wellington topped with foie gras. SF is a HUGE fan of the tv show and apparently, the Beef Wellington is a thing lol. SF also loves foie gras so she indulged with a smile. Because we were celebrating both of their birthdays, mom and SF received complimentary Sticky Toffee Pudding with Speculoos ice cream. I'm blaming Charlie because I received a complimentary one as well, without the candle, haahaaa. I don't know what speculoos is but it was the ABSOLUTE BEST pairing to this sticky toffee pudding that looked like a bran muffin. THE DESSERT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!  \n\nSummation: Will I return? MOST DEFINITELY! Will I get the potato gratin? Never! Will I try something else besides the NY strip steak? Yes! I plan to try everything on this menu. I was pleased with the restaurant overall. Reservations need to be made at least three weeks in advance during the summer. For the winter, I'd suggest the same.","date":"2018-10-08 00:11:26"}

It was amazing to see the former space of Serendipity transformed into the reimagined Hell's Kitchen. I loved that they kept with the theme of an open kitchen with a blue and red team. The dining space is huge and it's really nice for lunch service with the large windows illuminating the natural lighting from the Strip. Since it just opened a little over a month ago, reservations are harder to snag, but my friend managed to get one for Sunday lunch service.\n\nWalking in, there were several menu items that I have been dying to try. The first was the lobster risotto. How many times have I watched Ramsay scream about the risotto? Countless. This time, he would have been proud. The lobster risotto was my favorite dish of the day. The butternut squash was so creamy. You got an entire lobster tail, cut up into individual bite-sized pieces. It was sweet, savory, and everything in-between; a must-try for any guest. Another favorite was the wagyu meatballs, which had a very beefy flavor. \n\nI ended up getting the three-course express lunch menu, which featured a choice of caesar's salad or pumpkin soup, the beef Wellington, and the sticky toffee pudding. I chose the pumpkin soup, which was beautifully plated and served and poured table-side. I enjoyed the crunchy toasted pepitas. As for chef's signature dish, the beef Wellington did not disappointed. I was amazed by how well-cooked and tender the filet was. The mustard, prosciutto, and duxelles was masterfully incorporated. \n\nFor dessert, the sticky toffee was another amazing dish. Served with speculoos ice cream, it was so soft, buttery, and left you wanting more.\n\nNow for the bad and the ugly:\nSince we went for lunch, the all day breakfast part of the menu featured eggs in purgatory. I don't know if it was some kind of sick joke, but the eggs were one of the worst dishes I've had of any breakfast menu ever. I guess those are the eggs they serve in hell. The spicy tomato sauce was so salty, it made the eggs and everything else inedible. If chef was there, he would've probably thrown the eggs across the kitchen followed with \"Who made these eggs?!?\" Yea, that bad. \n\nThe experience was fun, the servers were great, but the actual speed of the service was quite slow. There were highlights and lowlights, much of what was to be expected from a restaurant opened by a celebrity chef in Las Vegas.","date":"2018-03-15 05:53:30"}

The hostesses were so pleasant and very helpful. We got stuck in really bad traffic and were running late, but they made sure that we still got to dine at the restaurant and were really nice to us. \n\nWe finally got seated and introduced to our waiter...not sure if he was having a bad day or if this is just how he always is, but we all felt like he was annoyed at us. Whenever we would ask a question he'd talk to us in the most condescending tone and it was extremely uncomfortable. All other servers that helped us (the server who filled our water glasses, the ones that brought us our food, etc.) were so nice and attentive to our questions. They never made us feel incompetent, but unfortunately our waiter did. It wasn't until the end that he was all smiles with us and trying to joke around, which just doesn't look good for a waiter to do. It really felt like he was trying so hard to be nice so that we'd leave a good tip. I am so disappointed. Part of the dining experience at any restaurant is the service. I expected EXCELLENT service being that I was dining at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and that is not what I received. \n\nThe food was really good. We ordered from the prix fixe menu which came with Scallops, Beef Wellington, and Sticky Toffee Pudding. The scallops were to die for!! The Beef Wellington was flavored perfectly, but we were expecting the shell to be more crispy and flaky. It was too doughy for our liking. The sticky toffee pudding perfect. So delicious and satisfying! We also ordered the mac & cheese as a side. It was good, but nothing to write home about. \n\nOverall, I wish the waiter had been nicer to us. It really put a dent in our experience. I feel that we didn't get to enjoy it as much as we would have if we'd had a different waiter.","date":"2018-02-20 18:45:51"}

The cook, food runner, etc. could clearly see they were burnt. No one came back to even ask how it was. Then came the Beef Wellington...after waiting- again, for far too long. The meat itself was cooked well; however, it was bland. The pastry was dry and over cooked. The mashed potatoes- bland. The only redeeming part of the dinning experience was the toffee bread pudding.

However, this was a most disappointing experience. \n\nWe managed to get lunch reservations last minute.  Maybe that is why they sat us at bar tops instead of a regular table.  Don't know.  We got there early, were sat promptly but this is about when the promptness stops.  We ordered simple lunches.  Mushroom pizza and the lobster risotto.  To start with, we ordered the scallops appetizer.  \n\nWe mentioned to the server hubby is attending a conference and short on lunch time as we were sat.  She said no problem.  We immediately placed our order for everything and the appetizer came out 10 minutes or so later.  Sadly, the scallops were the smallest, thinnest scallops I'd ever seen.  They seriously have to have been cut in half because I never saw scallops this size before.  Also, they were overcooked.  Because they were so thin they didn't need to be cooked long, but they were so mine was a tad rubbery - even given the thinness of the scallop.  \n\nDisappointment didn't stop there... because it was now 10... 20.... 30.... 40.... 50 minutes more of a wait til we got our lunch.  Server stops by a few times to say not sure it will to be too much longer.  After a couple of times, she stopped coming by completely.   Hubby finally looks at his watch... yeah.... I gotta go back he says.  He leaves.  (This was his birthday lunch mind you).  He has to go back to his training class MINUS food- oh except for  the 1 1\/2 scallops he got to eat.  \n\nFood comes out almost an hour to the time we were there.  \nThey bring it out and I ask her to just wrap it up since husband left already.  Pizza looked ok, tasted ok back in the room at the Bellagio.  Unfortunately a little soggy since it was packed in a plastic container too. \n Thats partly my fault though since I didn't want to sit there and eat two meals by myself.  However, nothing amazing I couldn't get at a local pizzeria.  Risotto tastes like its undercooked... WTF... \n\nAll in all, yes, its a tourist trap, I knew it was.

I can see why the Beef Wellington is his signature dish. A fair warning, it's a big piece where it could be shared. The risotto seemed a bit over cooked but the lobster on top more than made up for it. That lobster was excellent! We also tried the braised short rib. Super tender and very good. The Brussel sprouts are a must!! They are honestly the best brussel sprouts that I have ever had! They were so flavorful. Also the Mac n Cheese side dish was delicious. They use truffle oil where you can taste the truffle when you take a bite. All shareable portions! I would suggest to not order duplicates and share everything.

The sauce and mushrooms went well with it and i liked the peppers too. \n\nBeef Wellington- so tender and it comes out medium rare.

It is a solid 5 stars.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Not that I would expect anything less from the inimitable Gordon Ramsay.  But you know, it is still a new restaurant, and it is in a tough location (several other ventures didn't make it there), with a predominately tourist crowd.  So I went with somewhat tampered down expectations.  I was so gratified by this experience.\n\nFirst, the service was impeccable.  Great smiles, attentive service, and a super amazing server, George.  He could not be better whether he was a server at Robuchon. He was knowledgeable about the menu, helped reassure my picky-eater friend who had a thousand questions about the menu (some good, others a bit idiosyncratic, like fearing the standard medium-rare Beef Wellington).  George knew wine pairings, and made my buddy, who is an aspiring sommelier, impressed and satisfied with his selections.  She even took pictures of the bottles.  It was my pal's birthday, and they treated her regally.  Our table was perfect, sitting out over Las Vegas boulevard.  And before we left, George took our photo in front of the kitchen.\n\nSecond, the food? It was unimpeachable.  Oysters from Washington, tasted like they were just plucked from a river outside, and were luxuriously presented with little Tabasco sauce bottles, a beautiful mignonette sauce and cocktail sauce to knock your socks off.  I was sheepish about it, but yes, I did suck both of them down even after the oysters were done.  \n\nThe lobster risotto.  Textbook perfect plus.  Creamy, sincere (yes, I used that word for food), and sure of itself.  The poached lobster could have been used to teach a clinic. This was an appetizer.   I wish there was an entree version.  \n\nI was only feeling slightly peckish, so I decided to forego an entree, per se, and have another appetizer instead.  I went for a traditional Scottish \"hangover\" dish (though there was no actual need), and add french fries.  It was delicious.  The over easy egg was perfectly cooked and went nicely with the rich red sauce and feta cheese.  The french fries boldly exemplified what french fries are supposed to be.  \n\nThe toffee cake with ice cream was splendid.\n\nWould I come back? In a shake of a lamb's tail.","date":"2018-10-29 00:49:48"}

With that in mind, they dialed up one off of the Food Network's one and only Gordon Ramsay and of course he was interested. \n\nThe exterior is an obnoxious blend of concrete​, metal, and Gordon Ramsay's face. Inside you will find more of the same. Gordon is seemingly everywhere with no less than 30 photos of himself along with a wall of every series winner from the television program that shares its​ name with this restaurant​. Gordon really is unabashed​ with the smearing his likeness anywhere it will fit in this themed restaurant​ geared for the global tourist​ set in Vegas. \n\nThe service is solid, albeit slow, particularly​ at peak times which is when you would want to visit. Even with reservations made well in advance,​ we waited patiently for over twenty minutes as a table for six was readied for us on a Saturday night. Once seated, ​however, our server was gregarious​, knowledgeable, and quick to react. \n\nIt would be remiss​ of any visitor​ to pass up on the chance to try the handcrafted cocktails available and with that in mind the men at the table ordered the Smoke on the Boulevard​ cocktail​ featuring Woodford Rye along with Aperol, Amaro Averna, and sweet Vermouth served elegantly in a glass container with Cherry Wood smoke that dazzles the senses while served. The drink itself is superb and perfectly balanced as it should be with the stiff $16.00 price tag attached to it. There is plenty​ of punch in the Rye so one is all that is necessary​ to get a solid buzz going before the cuisine starts making its way to the table. \n\nAs an appetizer,​ we shared the Oysters on a half shell and we were lucky enough to come at a time when the Kusshi varietal was in-season which sports a sweet and briny flavor and is best adorned with the provided HK MIgnonette and a dab of Gin Cocktail Sauce. A dozen will set you back roughly $40.00, so I recommend you enjoy them slowly. \n\nFor the main entree,​ I opted for Gordon's widely acclaimed Beef Wellington​ and although it takes time to prepare - it did not disappoint. A thick and expertly prepared Beef Filet is wrapped tightly in Puff Pastry and then roasted to a quintessential medium​-rare and served with Potato Puree, Glazed Root Vegetables, and the most robust Red Wine Demi-Glace I can recall in recent memory. From the quality of the meat to the delicate Puff Pastry, this is the perfect example of Beef Wellington​ and my new bar against any other. I know I am gushing here and trust it is warranted. Easily the best $50.00 I spent while I visited Las Vegas this time around. \n\nI will be fully transparent in that I wanted to loathe and scathe everything about Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen from the moment I stepped through the doors but I simply cannot. Everything from the work being done in the open kitchen to the results that came from it was​ utterly remarkable​. Sure, it lacks the Michelin stars of his Chelsea​ location in England​ and is far too boisterous, but this is Vegas after all...\n\nI highly recommend.","date":"2018-07-16 14:34:10"}

It came with your choice of a Caesar salad or asparagus soup. I chose the salad and it was delicious. I do like my salads with a little more dressing, but that's just my preference. It was really fresh and the toasted parmesan was delicious . Next I had the Beef Wellington, it was absolutely delicious! All the ingredients went so well together. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection. I finished it off with The Sticky Toffee pudding and we also ordered a Pinapple Carpaccio for the table that had such a  cool presentation! However, flavor wise I definitely recommend the Sticky Toffee Pudding hands down! My Mom ordered the Short Rib grilled cheese and was in Heaven and our friend ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger.

Sam went over the menu and paid special attention to the dietary restrictions that both my husband and I have; she offered suggestions on which foods we should avoid even if there were only trace amounts of the allergenic ingredients present in a dish.  She was attentive throughout the meal, but not overly so, and even made sure \"Hell's Kitchen\" Season 17 winner and Head Chef Michelle Tribble stopped by our table to say hi.  She was very nice and, again, because I don't watch the show, I didn't know her from Adam, but it was very cool to meet her and our friends who are big fans of the series were super excited.  The items that I ordered, the Red Quinoa salad to share and the Braised Short Rib, were fantastic.  I always order short rib if it's on the menu and the version here was that perfect fall-off-the-bone served with a creamy polenta and a beef jus that were delicious.

However, I saw great reviews of this place and I'm staying at Caesars so I got a reservation via OpenTable.  It is still pretty full all the time, so I'd definitely recommend reservations -- a lot easier during the day than for dinner.\n\nSeated immediately based on my reservation time.  Menu explained by my waitress, and I ordered immediately -- the prix fixe lunch deal for $60, plus an extra signature appetizer (lobster risotto), espresso, and sparkling water.  Total came out to $4.50 ($104.50 minus my annual $100 annual Caesars Total Rewards Diamond dinner voucher), and because I'm not an animal, I tipped based on the full amount (which surprised the waitress, which makes me fear for humanity).  So, not an inexpensive place, but great food.\n\nLobster risotto ($24) was possibly my favorite dish.  Perfect risotto, butternut squash, and maybe 4oz of perfectly prepared lobster on top.  Apparently this is a signature dish which is always on the TV show -- I can see why, because it is technically challenging to prepare.\n\nPumpkin soup -- great soup, with some pepper oil and various \"bits\" in the bowl, with the soup poured over tableside.\n\nBeef Wellington: surprisingly good. Also, I think this is $49 on the menu solo, or $60 in the prix fixe, so I would always order in the set.  I'd only ever had badly executed Beef Wellington on cruise ships and event food; this was an entirely different dish.\n\nSticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream -- decent, but not my favorite style of dessert, with too much focus on sweetness and not much complexity.  But, this does seem to be popular, and was good.\n\nOverall, a good restaurant, although definitely on the pricier end, and hard to get a table, in a town full of great restaurants (including a bunch by Gordon Ramsay himself). The dining room is large and open and thus a bit loud, and while there is a somewhat open kitchen, it seems like they dialed back the \"two competitive teams preparing custom menus\" to \"popular dishes from the show\".  I'd  recommend trying the place if you have a chance.","date":"2018-04-13 06:45:36"}

So we sat down at the high-tops at the bar, however a few short minutes later the manager comes up and says there must have been a mix up as the high-tops in the bar are apart of the dining area?\n\nSo we move to the bar, but of course having someone under the age of 21 we aren't allowed there either. The bartender Kat (I hope I got her name right) was amazing, talked to the manager again and explained the situation. She was able to get them to seat us in the dinning room if we just wait near the hostess stand. We start to walk up and the dumb hostess thanks us for visiting. Uh, did you just forget the conversation you just had with Kat and the manager 30 seconds ago. She looks dumbfounded when I tell her we were just told to wait for a table. They seat us immediately! So much for being completely booked.\n\nNow the meal, absolutely amazing and the wait staff was on point. Barbra was our waitress and just the best! I will only eat here when she is here.

Reservations are highly recommended if you're interested in dining here. Just like the show, they decorated the kitchen into 2 sides. The menu features famous dishes frequently displayed on the show like the beef wellington, scallops, and lobster risotto. \n\nHilariously, just like the show, the dishes can be hit and miss. The beef wellington with foie was fantastic! but i couldn't have it because it was filled with butter. We got the cauliflower on the side and that was also fantastic -- best western-style cauliflower I've ever had!\n\nThe scallops were made well but nothing out of the ordinary and the risotto was so salty we thought about sending it back. \n\nOverall, our $200 meal here (for 2 with 1 cocktail) was a fun experience but definitely a little overpriced for the food, just like everything else in sin city.","date":"2018-10-14 02:11:48"}

Honestly what the hell is going on with the fries man. If ya gonna drop cash which I did. Why would you serve mediocre fries? Sorry Gordon but the fries did not taste fresh they taste frozen. Kinda similar to jack in the box fries. Lol another funny thing was the waitresses they look like they were like taken from the 40s lol  I don't really understand the concept.

We went on a Monday night figuring it would be less busy...wrong. Was jamming.  Were seated a few minutes before our reservation time, nice table in the window overlooking the strip.  Service was a little slow at first, but we soon realized why.  Everyone wants to talk about the show.  We heard the servers telling everyone over and over again about how to get a picture with the Hells Kitchen winner Michelle.  (She was very gracious and took a picture with us despite being really busy). My wife did the price fix menu for 72with the scallops, beef Wellington and sticky toffee pudding for dessert.  I had the scampi prawns flambé, the crispy skin salmon, a side of the Brussels sprouts and the pineapple carpaccio dessert.  Everything was excellent!  Each course better than the one before it.  The Wellington was cooked medium rare and was melt in your mouth delicious. The scallops were done perfectly, only complaint is they slice them thin, so it's not a full scallop. The prawns are set on fire table side, it's very impressive.  The Brussels sprouts are done in a vinegar sauce that gives them a little kick, they were so good.  The salmon is served skin up, and it was crispy.  The pineapple dessert is done with dry ice center so it comes to you smoking, it was really cool.  Just be warned I tried to spear a piece of pineapple and toppled the whole thing over, it's a little tricky to eat but the combo of the coconut ice cream and thin pineapple was so good.  Reminded me of a dole whip.  Our server was derek and he was really good, very attentive and answered all our questions and even got us Michelle's autograph on a napkin ($15 for the napkin but it's really a nice napkin). Well worth the price and we like a slow dining experience, so the pace of courses was just right.","date":"2018-03-13 06:12:11"}

We were fortunate to be seated toward the back, away from the entrance and near the floor-to-ceiling walls of glass overlooking the strip. Jaw-droppingly beautiful. Service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly. It was a nice meal, but nothing really wowed us. Maybe a case of too-high expectations, but there you go. We shared the smoked beet salad. Attractively presented under a glass dome that contained the smoke. It was a nice salad, but we felt the golden beets were overwhelmed by the smoke and other elements. I had the filet mignon. It was good, but not great - I felt like it was a bit lacking in beef flavor. David enjoyed his short ribs, served over polenta, more. Neither of us felt like the roasted tomatoes on our plates added much. The side of roasted cauliflower that we shared, however, was very good. For dessert we shared a chocolate mousse cake, and it was a letdown, both the somewhat dry cake and the too-strong passion fruit gelato that didn't seem the right accompaniment.

But then again the food is [beep]ing well done.\n\nPersonal rant:  I've been a fan of Gordon Ramsay since I ate at his flagship restaurant in London in the mid 2000's.  That along with his Boxwood Cafe and Maze, changed my perception of UK food.  He was a chef and restaurateur.  Sadly, his Vegas restaurants are largely all about capitalizing on image and name and far less so about the food (Gordon Ramsay Burger, Gordon Ramsay Fish and Chips... need I say more?)  End rant.\n\nStraight up, ignore the ridiculous decor, branding and merchandising.  Focus instead on the food.  In general, if you've heard it mentioned on the show, order it.  Portions are sensibly reduced which allows for a complete meal at a more affordable price.\n\nFor starters, the lobster risotto is very well done.  British style (thicker risoto) loaded with butternut squash puree that adds earthy sweetness backed by sage and an up front lobster broth all topped by a tender, butter poached lobster tail.  The seared scallops, equally impressive.  Cut in half, then incredibly well seared and seasoned scallops.  A pickled apple and celery root slaw provides the perfect acidic foil.  This dish is \"devour\" worthy!\n\nThe standout main, the beef wellington.  Perfect cook on the tenderloin, the initial searing and coating with Dijon mustard adds the perfect acidic zing and counterbalances the rich duxelles.  Well cooked pastry.  It all pairs well with the slightly sweet, syrupy red wine demi.  The silky potato puree, heaven.  Right behind in quality, the crispy skin salmon.  Though slightly over, the skin is so ethereally crisp it more than makes up for it.  The citrus herb beurre blanc adds great richness and acidic balance.  \n\nFor dessert, sticky toffee pudding.  Nuff said.\n\nService is enthusiastic but seems forced.  It will improve with time.\n\nOK beverage program with lots of themed drinks.  OK wine list.  High Vegas resort markup.\n\nBottom line, [beep]ing  good.  That said,  if you're willing to spend a bit more, do yourself a favor and hit up Gordon Ramsay Steak instead.  Yes it's still themed but it delivers the same dishes at twice the quality and much more to offer.","date":"2018-04-05 15:15:59"}

Very nice ambiance and, as fan's of both Gordon and the show, watching the red and blue kitchens was quite unique. The only missing piece was Gordon Ramsey screaming for one kitchen or the other to get out!  \n\nWe were seated by the window, looking over Las Vegas Blvd. Carlos, our waiter, was fantastic. He explained the entire menu to us, took his time, and was very friendly. He took care of everything we asked. My wife ordered the filet and I had the three-course signature option. \n\nThe pan-seared scallops came out first. My wife does not care for scallops so I had to consume them all. They tasted fine. The beef wellington was delicious and the caramel sticky pudding was incredible. We both left full and happy. It was only a few hours later that I began to get severe stomach cramps. We were playing at the Mirage when I began to feel ill. We then started back to our hotel and, before we could get across the street, I violently threw up in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd. Once my stomach was empty, the cramps subsided nearly instantly and I was fine the rest of the evening. My only guess is that the scallops made me sick. I hope others have a better experience than I. In hindsight, I should have ordered the caesar salad.","date":"2018-11-02 20:20:49"}

We ordered the lobster risotto and seared scallops, gosh they were both so good!! It taste as good as it looks and definitely worth the price. I also tried his crispy skin salmon which was great. The other components like the lentils and fennel salad complemented the salmon, ugh so good! Someone in my party thought it was too salty, but it was fine for me. \n\nEveryone else had the golden beat salad which tasted really earthy and great combination with the salmon as well, the hells kitchen burger, and short rib grilled cheese. Oh and of course we tried his signature sticky toffee pudding which was delicious! We were celebrating my birthday so they added another complimentary one for us :)\n\nThe experience of dining at hell's kitchen is a must!

One problem that most celebrity restaurants have is that they rely on their novelty. Hell's Kitchen, however, relies on the quality of food which is exceptionally fresh and tasty. The entrance is grand and extravagant, almost to the point of comical but the contemporary interior is modern and inviting. The floor to ceiling glass windows offer a great view of the strip which is only rivaled by the fabulous service. The servers are quite knowledgeable about the menu, friendly and attentive but not intrusive. \n\nThe highlight is, of course, the food which is filled with flavors but not overbearingly so. The Pan Seared Scallops to start is a very strong option as they are cooked to perfection, firm but not tough and flavorful but not over-seasoned. The Beet Salad is one of the best Beet salads I've ever had, firm, sweet and lying over a bed of Greek Yogurt. The Beef Wellington looked amazing and is Gordon Ramsay's staple but on this occasion, we ordered the Chicken Scappolini which was very tender. The final stroke was the Sticky Coffee Pudding which one of most delicious desserts ever. \n\nOverall, Hell's Kitchen is an amazing experience with good service, great decor and food which rivals the best restaurants in the world.","date":"2018-10-17 17:38:03"}

So when our main course arrive my fiancée sat there with her appetizer plate still in front of her and I sat there with no silverware. I had to ask for silverware and her appetizer plate was left in front of her even though mine and the appetizer dish had long been cleared.\n\nMy beef Wellington was very good but I found myself wishing the reduction was a bit more abundant beneath it so I could have that layer of flavor through my whole food.\n\nMy fiancée had the fillet minion and ordered it well done and perhaps this is why but it came out looking a bit more like strip steak. Though it tasted great.\n\nOrdered a side of Brussel sprouts which came with a sweet chili sauce. These were great as well but I found myself thinking the sauce was not very different from a sweet chili sauce I could have bought. I think had it been me I would have sliced thin and crisped a little Brussel sprouts along with to add some unique texture to the sauce as the Brussel sprouts were of a more steamed nature which was fine.\n\nAfter these items we were full but I felt this was an opportunity so I asked for the peanut butter cheesecake to go. We sat for awhile and it never came and I was brought the bill while waiting. I provided my card for payment. Only then did the new waiter realize that he hadn't put in the cheesecake correctly. So now I got the bill back with the cheesecake added and an apology though no discount and we waited further.\n\nWe then got our cheesecake in a bag and a member of the staff was kind enough to take a picture in front of the kitchen.\n\nStopped in the restroom on the way out. Nice but the area around the sink was so dirty some of it I'm sure scratches in the counter top and perhaps not all dirty.\n\nWalked back to our hotel and decided to pull out the peanut butter cheesecake. Found a long skinny flat cheesecake in a big container. Any semblance of presentation gone. A few bits of chocolate and peanuts crumbled around the sliver of cheesecake less an issue then not enough depth or anything resembling a peanut butter flavor.

We were out here for my 30th birthday and it was one of the things on our bucket list. I was so excited to meet Michelle and finally try the famous Beef Wellington. We only had to wait for a few minutes. Everything was just amazing! I ordered an old fashioned and it came in a beautiful highball glass with a large square ice cube and a Hell's Kitchen logo branded on the orange peel. We already knew we were going to do the pre fix menu. We both ordered the scallops, beef Wellington and the sticky toffee pudding. The scallops were melting in my mouth they were soooo good!! When we got our beef Wellington's we were very surprised how big they were. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was one of the best things I've ever had. I'm not a huge dessert person but the sticky toffee pudding was amazing! We also order the baked Mac and cheese as a side and are still craving it!! Everything was incredible!! The only complaint I have is that our server was not attentive at all. He was actually up at the hostess stand most of our dinner in what seemed like flirting with the girls then actually attending to our needs. Thank goodness for the Busser\/server assistant that was extremely attentive to our table. The server took our order, asked how our food was and then took about 10 minutes to bring us our check after we asked for it. We saw him 3 times. The busser was constantly at our table clearing plates, boxing food, Brininging us drinks and answering our questions. The server didn't even go over the menu or anything. His service was the equivalent of what you would get at applebees. I really hope the bussers get a good tip out because he deserved way more. We were so excited to come here and although the food was incredible our server ruined part of this experience for us. We will def be back though.","date":"2018-06-07 15:57:53"}

The place is huge and the ambiance is very cool. They set up a kitchen just like in the show so it makes for a really cool view. \n  We both decide to order the Signature Pre-fixe ($68 each) meal which includes an appetizer, entree and a dessert. We order the Cesar salad and the scallops. The salad was just okay, nothing too great but I loved the home-made croutons but there were only a couple so I had to ask for more to even complete the salad plus it seems a tad under dressed for my tastes. The scallops were delish, I think it was a corn puree on the bottom? Very tasty. But definitely if you decide to order the pre-fixe - get the scallops. More for your money, although ours were sliced in half so you're not getting as much as you think you are. As an extra side we ordered their macaroni and cheese and I'd recommend that all day, very cheesy with a smokey bacon flavor.\n    The Beef Wellington was the entree and it was an awesome cut of meat, I've had wellington only once before but this meat was so tender it was like slicing into butter. Then, at last, the Sticky Toffee Pudding as dessert. This is a very sweet, spongy dessert. I've never had it before and it was just delicious. \n   I ended up having to get a to-go container because I couldn't eat all the goodies, but I was bummed when I got home that they placed my wellington in the container but not the demi-glaze or puree that was left on the plate with it :\/ Overall, fun experience and yummy food.

I went here for my 21st birthday and it blew me away. I always admired chef Gordon Ramsay and his philosophy on food and service. I made a reservation 2 months in advance to secure a spot. The hostess were very nice and well dressed. The atmosphere was beautiful and fast pace. I ordered the lobster RISOTTO and it was TO DIE FOR. It was absolutely the best thing I have ever ate in my life. It was everything I ever wanted. It reminded me of home. And the lobster was cooked to perfection. For my main course I got the beef Wellington and it just melts in your mouth cooked to perfection with some mash potatoes and carrots. Then we had the sticky toffee pudding. Don't let the name fool you. It's not too sweet it is the right amount of flavor and the ice cream was so mouth watering. It was so good that my boyfriend even loved the dessert and he dislikes sweets. \n\nI would also like for the manager or who is in charge of the floor staff to know that Antonio was absolutely a delight he took care of us very well very attentive. You guys are super lucky to have him. I honestly think he took better care for us than our server but she was great too. He should definitely become a server.","date":"2018-10-30 03:36:01"}

I lost my passion for gastronomy six years ago after eating at Alinea and wondering wtf I was doing with my life spending hundreds of dollars on terrible food. Don't get me wrong, I still love fine dining but on a daily basis, I no longer seek new restaurants to try, I'm no longer adventurous with food, and I only stick to places that are tried and true. Simply put, I've become a basic bitch.\n\nAll this changed over the weekend at Hell's Kitchen.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay despite having mediocre experiences at his namesake restaurant in LA (now closed) and BurgR over at Planet Hollywood. I don't even watch his TV shows, yet I love the guy. I was hugely disappointed to find out Serendipity was closing but very excited to learn that it would be replaced with Hell's Kitchen, a restaurant based on Ramsay's hit TV show of the same name.\n\nReservations for lunch were easily made a week in advance. We got there 30-minutes late, but I called the hostess earlier letting her know and there were no problems. We were seated within 10-minutes.\n\nWe were told the restaurant is modeled after the set on the TV show, but my friend and I aren't fans so it meant nothing to us. However, they did a fantastic job renovating the space and it's gorgeous. You could see the devil in the details, on the columns, light fixtures, everything.\n\nHibiscus Sour - $8\nTea with lemon and simple syrup, this is one of my favorite drinks and they made it perfectly. I wish more places served this mix. I've only had it at one other place (Guisados).\n\nLobster Risotto - $25\nYES, YES, YES! This is a must if you like truffles and lobster. I was legit moved to tears, and my friend looked at me like I was insane. Everything about this dish was perfect. The risotto was soft and fluffy with strong authentic flavors of truffle. The butter-poached lobster tail was cooked on point, very fresh. I'm all about texture so the crispy onions were an added delight. I'd go back and just order two of these for my main entree alone.\n\nEggs in Purgatory - $19\nThis was mentioned a lot on Yelp and I hated it. Two poached eggs over sourdough toast sprinkled with feta cheese and soaked in spicy tomato sauce. To be fair, I hate feta cheese so would not recommend.\n\nPumpkin Soup - $14 (included in prix fixe)\nNot a fan of pumpkin but it was this or Caesar's salad as my choice of appetizer. I had two sips.\n\nBeef Wellington - prix fixe $75 for 6 oz. or $62 for 3 oz.\nThis was way, way better than the beef wellington I had in Ramsay's restaurant in LA. It was so good with the red wine demi-glace, but I was so full and could only finish half of it. Should've ordered the 3 oz instead because the other half is still sitting in my fridge.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding - $11 (included in prix fixe)\nServed with speculoos ice cream, this is a must! It was surprisingly a large portion but it was so good, I easily finished 3\/4 of it by myself. The ice cream scoop could have been a lot bigger cos the pudding:ice cream ratio was definitely off, but it was so tasty, I didn't mind all that much.\n\nService was decent, no complaints.\n\nMaybe I haven't completely changed because I'm still eating junk food on a daily basis that all modern foodies would frown upon (lol); but Hell's Kitchen has helped reignite a small flame of passion for food again. I just can't wait to come back and get more of that lobster risotto and sticky toffee pudding!","date":"2018-10-11 02:59:31"}

Only until my boyfriend inquired did she suggest waiting for a seat at the bar which was first come first serve. At first, our bartender seemed like she'd be great. She suggested 'Notes from Gordon' for a drink and I really enjoyed it. It was only until I got home days later that I realized there was an actual note from Gordon Ramsay. She definitely could've told me as I would've liked to read it for fun, but not a big deal. For my meal I ordered the braised short rib. It was delicious but it didn't stand out as anything different from any other American restaurant. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a medium rare steak. It came out rare. We asked the steak to be cooked to medium rare but when it came back it was medium well and now it was dry with no juice left.

The silky mashed potatoes were a highlight. Its a hearty meal overall. I wish I had shared! A waiter walked by with a couple orders of Mac n cheese. They were huge servings for a side! Though mac n cheese can be a hit or miss and is on every restaurant menu, I ended up ordering one for the table impulsively after a glimpse.

I made the reservation on OpenTable about a month in advance and it was already running out of openings. Luckily, both my boyfriend and I like eating late so a 9.15pm reservation was perfect for us. \n\nI have wanted to try a Ramsay restaurant for a long time, but other than trying his burger restaurant in Vegas (which I don't think really counts), I've never had the chance. So I was excited for this! The restaurant itself reminds you a lot of the Hell's Kitchen you see on the show (obviously) and the chef is the winner from the past season (she was there and graciously took a lot of pics with people). \n\nThe staff was amazing throughout the evening. Every table had a server and an assistant so you were always quickly acknowledged if you needed anything. \n\nAs an appetizer, we decided to try the wagyu meatballs in tomato sauce with polenta croutons. The highlight of this dish was definitely the tomato sauce. It was exploding with flavor and really, really good. \n\nFor mains, I tried the classic beef wellington and my boyfriend got the dry aged new york strip. We also tried the baked mac & cheese and the potato gratin. The beef wellington was excellent and just as good as I've imagined. The only \"negative\" was that it was only lukewarm when it came out, so it made me question if it had been sitting out for a while. The new york strip was perfectly cooked as well. The baked mac and cheese was creamy and really good, but the potato gratin was a bit disappointing and wasn't creamy or seasoned at all. \n\nWe weren't planning on getting dessert since we were so full, but the staff surprised us and treated us to a toffee pudding because it was our anniversary. I'm so glad they did! I wouldn't not have ordered the toffee pudding otherwise, but it was freaking amazing. It came out warm and gooey, and I just couldn't stop eating it. It went so well with the speculoos ice cream as well. \n\nOverall, a well worth visit if you're looking for some good food! It's a little pricey, but it's a steakhouse after all.

For our entrees, we got the beef Wellington (I know it sounds weird but you HAVE to try it) and the short rib, both of which were recommended by our incredible server Brittney. Everything was cooked perfectly, and you hardly needed a knife! We polished dinner off with two nitro cold brew coffees to keep us going for the evening. This place is CRAZY busy, and was reservations only when we arrived, so I strongly suggest booking a table weeks in advance like we did! 10\/10 would visit again!","date":"2018-07-05 16:47:46"}

Since when do you pay for water! Ok! I will come back to this.  First off, this was our 2nd time coming to Hells Kitchen. We brought along some of our friends this time. We have been hyping this place up for a few months. We fell in love with the Beef Wellington and the seafood tower. This time we did the same. \n\nService: Our waitress was very nice. However, my husband's wine glass wasn't cleaned. There was still left over wine. We were very disgusted by this. \n\nFood: The food was very good! No long wait. This time we also ordered the sticky toffee pudding which was AMAZING!! Our wine and our friend's cocktails were also very good!\n\nOk so the water....first time we came they just served water from a clear glass bottle. This was the free water. This time the server came around with blue and red bottles and asked if we wanted Sparkling or Still. I thought this was odd. But I just thought that maybe they wanted to add more variety. We asked for \"Still\". HUGE mistake.\n\nImagine our surprise with $24 for water on our bill. They didn't even tell us there was gonna be a charge for this water, which we thought was super shady. It's water! Most people don't expect to pay for regular water or \"still\" water. So needless to say our friends weren't thrilled, we were kinda embarrassed. To add insult to injury as we were leaving I saw a waiter bringing that glass bottle of water to another table. We felt bamboozled. If you see those bottles coming to your table, heads up!!\n\nWe won't be coming back.","date":"2018-10-08 06:39:00"}

FYI, if no one has ever told you, you don't go there very hungry.  The portions are just right for keeping your weight down...hint.. \n\nThe intro beet salad with something or other...meh. \nThe lobster risotto - hit.  I'd order a vat of that for sure if I won some big dollah jackpot. \nThe iron chicken.  glad I had some water to counter the DRY white breast.  That was it, just a breast, no wing.  My date ordered the beef wellington, and liked that one, but it sure wasn't big enough to share..or she didn't like me enough to share - one or the other.  ha\nThe sides: mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes.

Being a single diner I felt very well treated and the server was engaging without being intrusive. The second course was a lobster truffle risotto.  This is by far the best risotto I have ever eaten.  It had an amazing truffle flavour which didn't overpower the poached lobster which was cooked in a loving way. What's interesting is that I thought the main course would be a letdown.  Little did I know that the beef Wellington would not disappoint.  It was cooked to a perfect medium rare and could be cut with a butter knife.  During the meal I texted a friend of mine and said this was the best meal of my life.  I do not dispute that.  The macaroni and cheese side was outstanding - although probably too much food at this point and so was not finished.  The finishing touch was the sticky toffee pudding.

Then I was in Vegas for two back to back weeks. So I made reservations for eating here on my second week. I have been a big fan of Gordon's since his first shows aired. I had been lucky to eat at the Steak house and pub previously as well. So I had high expectations for our dinning experience. Let me saw that they exceeded those expectations in every way. First the service was exceptional. We were waited on by an excellent waitress. She took great care of our table. Secondly, the whole ambiance will be a big reason go here. The restaurant looks like what you would expect from a Hells Kitchen. It even has the full show kitchen with the red and blue kitchens. The neat touch is in the entry there is a wall dedicated to all the previous winners. Also outside they have the flaming HK moniker. Next the menu will feature most all items you have come to see featured on the show, such as lobster risotto, beef wellington, and scallops. Of note I would highly recommend you have reservations well in advance as this place was totally packed. Use open table around two weeks before you plan on going to vegas. That way you can get a reservation at a decen time. If you forgot to do this you might be able to eat very early ie 4:30, at lunch, or very late ie after 9:30. \n\nThe food-\nI ordered the following as well as tasted some of my dining party's items including the lobster risotto, flaming shrimp appetizer, and the beef wellington. The flaming shirmp is pretty cool to look at and tasted pretty good as well. It is a few shrimp on fire and isnt super sophisticated otherwise. However, the risotto is amazing and was what I imagined it would taste like. Easily my best risotto I have ever eaten. Also the beef wellington is great. The beef super tender surrounded by mushroom paste, and wrapped in pastry. Really exceptional. Also if you are here you should get a drink as they have some excellent choices. I got the Meet your maker and it was excellent. When it comes time for dessert you basically have one choice which will be getting the sticky toffee pudding with speculoos ice cream. Overall very impressive. Having been to the other locations in vegas that Gordon runs this is a hare better in facility and presentation. Some of the menu items you could get at the pub, or steakhouse, but there is literally only one Hells Kitchen. It has set a high dining mark that might take a while to be toppled in my book.","date":"2018-07-05 19:47:22"}

Chef Ramsay has created a restaurant that really looks like the show, down to the chefs wearing the colors and not crossing the center line of the kitchen.

The famed Beef Wellington lived up to the hype, as did the scallops.  Service was attentive but not over bearing.  The wine list is fairly lengthy and they feature a full bar with craft cocktails too.  I highly recommend the pineapple carpaccio for dessert, as well as the sticky toffee pudding. \nIf there was anything negative about our visit, the room was a bit noisy and the hostesses didn't greet us quickly; neither of these took away from an overall wonderful dinner experience.\nFor fans of the TV show, yes Michelle was there and she was very accommodating for everyone that wanted to meet her and take a picture.","date":"2018-08-10 20:35:14"}

I took note that the Grand Opening celebration would be during the same week we'd be staying in Las Vegas and looked into making dining reservations.  I luckily snagged a reservation for lunch as we \"squeezed\" this dine into our vacation.\n\nThis restaurant can be found on S Las Vegas Blvd on the same grounds as Caesar's Palace.  This building formerly housed Serendipity 3 and the Stripside Café.  There is parking in the Caesar's Palace parking lots or valet parking in front of the hotel's entrance.  However, it's very accessible to foot traffic along S Las Vegas Boulevard.\n\nUpon entry to Hell's Kitchen, you're greeted by a video image of Chef Ramsay as he invites you in.  You're surrounded by a Hell's Kitchen Gift Shop and met by the \"Wall of Winners (Hell's Kitchen)\".  Winner of season 16 was in house but whoever wins Season 17 will have the contract as the head chef of this kitchen.  As the hostess leads you to your seat, you'll undoubtedly take notice of the \"competition kitchen\" featuring Red and Blue Teams.  The high ceilings reveal chandeliers made up of Devil's Pitchforks.  Comfortable and masculine looking grey leather upholstered chairs, booths or banquettes fill the dining area without being overly crowded.\n\nLUNCH:  The lunch menu was straight-forward and as expected, fiery chili sauces or condiments were on the menu.  The beverage menu featured a variety of wines (red, white & rosé) by the glass, draught selections, cocktails and non-alcoholic aka mocktails.\n\n-hell's kitchen burger:  bacon, avocado, Fresno chili jam, crispy onion, ghost pepper cheese, and seasoned fries.  The burger doneness appeared to be medium-rare rather than medium-well as my husband requested.  But, nonetheless, my husband didn't complain and still enjoyed the flavorful burger. $22\n\n-short rib grilled cheese:  sourdough bread, caramelized onions, white cheddar cheese and fingerling potato chips.  Thankfully, this succulently-cooked boneless short rib sandwich wasn't a huge portion.  Its rich beefy flavor and tender bite worked well with the soft caramelized onions.  The melted white cheddar in this sandwich added a slight sharpness and the filling was slightly reminiscent of French Onion Soup.  The grilled sourdough bread held the tender filling in with each bite as some of the filling \"threatened\" to ooze out with each bite.

Went twice just to make sure.  Second time really confirmed it. From the moment we sat down it was clear our server Sandra was not having her best day at work.  Our table of 5 did not feel welcome by her in any way at all.  We arrived at 330pm so it was between lunch and dinner (only reservation) we could get.  2 in our party ordered the Hell's Kitchen Gordon Ramsay's signature dishes- one with wine pairings.  Two more of us orders burgers and the last one ordered the famous lobster risotto.  None of us were offered a drink order.  I ordered my burger medium rare, and my brother ordered his med well.  Both burgers came out as burnt hockey pucks.  I sent mine back- this is Hell's Kitchen and there was no pink in my burger even.  Sandra doesn't even say- I'm sorry about that- nothing.  Just would you like to keep your fries right now?  Yes- because by the time I got my burger back- everyone else was done eating.  Meanwhile my brother took one bite out of his hockey puck and then took it off the bun and never ate any more.  No one, Sandra, any of the other servers who picked up plates asked how our food was, if there was something wrong with it, nothing.  I will say when they brought mine back it tasted very good.  Those who got the Hell's Kitchen signature dishes loved it especially the sticky toffee pudding.  But we did have to wait 50 minutes between entrees and desserts to get them........Crazy!!  At the end of the meal when it was time for the bill, Sandra tells my husband, not me that they will not charge for my burger.  It would be really nice to acknowledge me- the one with the hockey puck burger to know you were comping my burger.

I absolutely love Gordon Ramsay and I expected a lot more from his restaurant. When we checked in, the hostesses were a little bit snooty. They did ask if we were celebrating anything special and I did say it was my friend's birthday. She said she would make a note of that. Our server was lovely though, which is part of the reason I gave three stars. She was so sweet and only parts of the food\/experience were wonderful. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the scallops, lobster risotto, and the short rib grilled cheese. \n\nWhile the risotto was amazing, the lobster was a horrible, overcooked, rubbery, and chewy mess. I had a lobster Mac and cheese at a TGI Friday's once and even their lobster was better. For a place known for their lobster risotto, I was definitely disappointed with the lobster at Hell's Kitchen. The lobster meat was extremely tough and not how it should be cooked.\n\nThe scallops were very thin and they weren't worth the money. I felt like they took one scallop and cut it into 5 pieces. \n\nThe short rib grilled cheese was very tasty, but parts of the sandwich were extremely burned and hard. I felt like I would break a tooth. Luckily, it was still very tasty. I would get it again and would request them to not toast the bread so much. They gave these pickled veggies with the sandwich that really enhanced the taste. \n\nNow, at this point, no one had acknowledged we were there for a birthday celebration. We saw other tables got complimentary sticky toffee puddings for their birthdays. Oh well, we were shy and decided not to say anything. We ordered the dessert anyway because we wanted to try it regardless. It was heaven in every bite. I would go back just for that dessert. It was worth every penny!\n\nAll in all, I wish the food quality had been better across the board. It definitely didn't seem like food quality that one would expect from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The servers were extremely nice, but the hostesses in front could have been nicer.","date":"2018-10-28 02:35:50"}

Pretty easy to get to of you take Uber or a taxi since the drop off and pick up is right there. Walking up to the restaurant, the first think you notice is the flaming HK outside. Pretty cool must say. The building itself was white but had a reddish glow..also pretty cool. If waiting for dinner, outside is pretty open though not much seating. If you wanted seats there are bars right next door (or you can try for the bar inside).\n\nInterior = 3\/5\nRight upon entering you are greeted with a video loop of Gordon Ramsey saying critiques about food. I kept myself entertained for a good five minutes just watching him. Aside from that the walls are adorned with shelves of the merchandise and pictures of previous Hell's Kitchen champions. I would say the waiting area was a little small considering how busting it was. We didn't wait too long since we had a reservation. I would say the spacing was alright but I would have liked a little more. The kitchen can be seen from some of the tables and it is split between red and blue coloring to mimic the actual show. In addition, I would say it was very hard to hear at times because of how loud the restaurant was which was a little meh for me.\n\nService = 5\/5\nOur server was very friendly and welcoming. He was quick to explain the menu and the workings of the restaurant. Food came out fast enough that it gave us time to chat and watch what was going on without us getting antsy.\n\nOrder = 4\/5\nNotes from Gordon: 5\/5\nFound this super refreshing and hit the spot just right. It was the perfect compliment to my meal. The note was also pretty funny and a nice little souvenir.\n\nHell's Kitchen Brew: 5\/5\nThis was a strong IPA, just like how my boyfriend likes it. He had no complaints and would order again.\n\nDinner menu (scallops, beef wellington, sticky toffee pudding): 4\/5\nI thought the scallops were good, nice and soft. The beef Wellington for me was a salty and I couldn't really pinpoint it. I think it was the puff pastry and the additional salt they put but it just tasted really salty. The filet mignon itself was soft and nicely finished. I really loved the sticky toffee pudding. They gave such a huge dessert portion to that I was physically struggling to finish it - and trust me my brain was trying to hold me back but my stomach was begging for more. It was sweet but not the kind that you were like \"ugh\". My only gripe is I wish I had more ice cream to go with it. I didn't finish because I ran out of ice cream and they pair so well together.\n\nOverall = 4\/5\nIt was a nice place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The drinks were great as well as the dessert. My boyfriend liked the beef Wellington, I am willing to give it another go but I am tempted to try something else (as shocking as that sounds). The ambiance itself is very energetic which reminds me of Vegas in general which is good and bad for some.\n\nHint = get a reservation to avoid waiting in line. Also get the prefixe menu and you can't go wrong.","date":"2018-11-10 00:25:53"}

Touristy?  Absomuthafuckinlutely!  Delicious?  Believe it!  What is probably the most difficult dinner reservation (1 month in advance is a good idea) to currently obtain in the city definitely hits the mark on what the mainstream public wants in their Hell's Kitchen.\n\nThe \"Lobster Risotto\" was tremendous; butter poached lobster tail, truffle risotto, crispy onions was absolute heaven in each and every bite.  I would have been totally down with this as an entrée if adding another tail with a side of caviar was an option.  Maybe I'll just get two orders and call it a night next time?\n\nWham, bam, thank you, LAMB!  Roasted rack of lamb with vadouvan carrots, bloomsdale spinach and harissa lamb jus was a terrific and there was nothing left but bone when I was done.  I am sure the Beef Wellington is the most popular dish since it's plugged ad nauseum on the show, but having had it several times at his steakhouse at Paris made me want to try something else and I didn't regret it at all.  \n\nIf it is your first time doing Ramsay dining, I would suggest more appetizers and actually splitting the Wellington with maybe the default sticky toffee pudding dessert to get more variety in the mouth while not feeling too overloaded at the end.  \n\nSo why 4 stars?  I prefer the steakhouse over HK primarily because of the more diverse menu.  In the snottiest thing I'll say for about an hour, I really wanted foie gras amongst other items.

I was afraid I would get SICK so I paid for it, but did not finish.  Next time I ordered, the lobster was like rubber.  Come on!  Eventually they got it correct (third try).\n\n(4) I ordered scallops which were good the first three times, but way overcooked on the fourth (near-solid brown and very dark).  The manager told me solid brown is the proper cook, but I know better.     (5) My mac-and-cheese tasted horribly bland, and then I realized it had no prosciutto (ham) because the chef forgot to add it!

Our waiter was heavy on the up-sell of shaved truffle ($28) on the main course- for me short ribs and husband shell steak.

But it looks so deliciously appealing on TV I thought I'd give it another try. Again, I was not impressed. Its not bad. Maybe its just not for me. It has a weird black paste coating the steak that I didn't care for either (to keep the breading from sticking to the meat???) \n\nI would have enjoyed a regularly prepared steak better instead. But the size of the Wellington here is much smaller than I remember at the Paris location. In fact, everything we ordered, from apps, mains, and dessert seemed like very small portions. For reference, my Wellington was about the size of a small cheeseburger from a happy meal at McDonalds. It was that small.\n\nThe lobster risotto is fantastic! You MUST try it if you eat here. But again, small in portion. The lobster tail on top was very tiny and the risotto itself was about a quarter of an inch deep in the plate. \n\nSo minus one star for the location of our table.

Lightly mixed in. \n\nBeef Wellington-heard this was their specialty, glad to have half of this and was able to try the rest. The meat was perfectly cooked not too hot but warm made it nice to just take a bite right away. Pastry was nicely thin and crisp hugging the juicy beef. Just perfect. \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding- ice cream was nicely paired with the pudding cake, we were already stuffed and couldn't finish this, it was super delicious. \n\nBaked Macaroni and Cheese- can go wrong with this, small portion but enough to share for small bites. \n\nBrussels Sprouts- nicely crisp like Pringles chip. \n\nPotato Gratin- small portion but didn't finish this, glad we ordered just one to share for our party, everything was delicious. \n\nWagyu Meatballs- had two orders of this highly recommend.

What a horrific experience I had here and I didn't even eat a damn thing. First let me start by saying Chef Gordon Ramsay is someone I look up to and admire and respect. He is the reason why I decided to get back into the kitchen and become a chef again. I started my own youtube channel because he inspired me. I ended up going to Las Vegas with my wife and celebrate our anniversary as well as my birthday. This was going to be the best birthday ever. I was excited because Chef Ramsay is my hero. What better way to celebrate my anniversary and birthday at his restaurant i was hoping it would be an unforgettable experience and let me tell ya! it really was unforgettable. I made reservations at 3:30 pm the day before and I was very lucky to get that and said it was meant to be. In major excitement my wife and I looked over the menu the night before while we were in our hotel and knew exactly what to order once we got our server at the table. We got there before the 3:30 time slot and were seated at 3:22 PM and our server came over and took our photo at 3:27PM. I have proof of the times. Our waitress came over who happen to be very cool and a very nice individual She handed us the menus and while she was still at our table we told her that we already looked at the menu at the hotel last night and knew exactly what we wanted I decided to open the menu and look for the Hell's kitchen burger just to see a menu view. I did not see it and I asked our waitress where are the burgers on the menu? she said this is the time transition going from lunch to dinner. She said let me go and talk to the line manager and see if I can get your order in for your burgers and she acknowledged that it was our anniversary and my birthday. The problem is it was not yet 3:30 and I did not see that to be a problem to throw two patties on the grill. She came back and said that the line manager said no and that they stopped taking orders for burgers. I was shocked so I thanked the waitress for trying and walked out of hell's kitchen restaurant. The worst part is as I was walking out my wife and I looked at the red teams side and they were making burgers and placing them on the counter to get picked up right as we were walking out of hell's kitchen. I never had this customer service that sucked so bad from any establishment I visited and really felt like that was a slap in the face. I guess i am not celebrity enough for them to have made me a freakin burger.  I really hope this message gets to Chef Ramsay because I am really F'n pissed off that I came all the way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to walk out of his restaurant disappointed and honestly up to today I cant get over the treatment i received. I ended up going to Tilted Kilt and ordered a $14 burger instead. I'm sure chef Ramsay would not want to be treated like this.","date":"2018-08-03 05:39:29"}

Everyone was super attentive, from refilling water to check in every so often.\nThe wait for the food wasn't too bad however I wished that wait for the table was shorter. \nCan't wait to try their prefixed lunch course next time!","date":"2018-10-29 01:06:15"}

Every single member working in the restaurant was smiling. \n\nI ordered the express lunch menu since I was there for the beef Wellington and the wine pairing. My hubby ordered lobster risotto and prime rib. \n\nMy appetizer was asparagus soup and the presentation was so unique. It was mouthwatering and my husbands risotto was delicious as expected. The wine for my appetizer was Tahbilk Marsanne and it was very light and delightful. My beef Wellington was out of this world paired with cabernet.My husband also enjoyed his prime rib and we finished with sticky toffee pudding paired with sandeman. \n\nEverything was so tasteful and delicious and the service was attentive and friendly. The only thing that kinda bothered me was that my 3 course got served under 40 minutes. I don't like to wait for my food to get to my table but at Hell's Kitchen service was so fast that I wasn't able to finish my wine with its own course. \n\nOverall it was in my bucket list to eat at Hell's Kitchen and it was well worth it. We enjoyed dinning here and the prices were fair as well.","date":"2018-09-11 03:33:26"}

But the food really is top notch. A bit pricey, just like everything else on the strip, but all our dishes were cooked to perfection. The lobster risotto was sublime - a lobster tail cut into pieces over the risotto. We loved the tuna tartare appetizer also.

The seating, the cutlery, the napkins, the atmosphere were all amazing. It felt more like an experience than a restaraunt.\n\nI ordered two entrées and a dessert. \n\nFirst I ordered the crispy skinned salmon. My friends told me it was amazing, but I thought it was very average. I am not sure what made this salmon so special. Second I ordered the braised beef rib. Again, the ribs were mediocre. Nothing was special about it.  Both my entrées were average... Which is a big disappointment when I was prepared to be blown away.\n\nThen I started to try my Co workers food. I had the Mac and cheese... It was the best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. It was a perfect blend of gouda cheese, macaroni and whatever else that was in it. It was mind browning.\n\nI then tried the beef Wellington. I was only able to get one bite, but that one bite was much better than both my entrées combined!\n\nWe then ordered the desert. We ordered the chocolate mousse cake and the toffee pudding. The mousse cake wad pretty bad. The raspberry overpowered the chocolate taste which was extremely disappointing. The toffee pudding however was just epic. It was this weird taste and texture which I cannot even explain. However, that pudding has to go down as my top 5 desserts ever.\n\nIn conclusion, the restaraunt has some epic dishes and some very average dishes. I'd recommend to just go with their prix fixe menu as the most popular items are on it.","date":"2018-02-23 08:16:16"}

As one would expect, the restaurant is themed like the television show with chefs sporting blue or red uniforms. I opted for the fixed price menu that featured some Gordon Ramsay favorites. His Beef Wellington was terrific, as was the sticky toffee putting. The room has a great look. Price points are predictably high. The most recent winner of the reality television show happened to be walking around on this particular evening. Her duties primarily seemed to be greeting and taking pictures with guests, which seems like a nice gig if you can get it. I prefer Gordon Ramsay Steak, which is also far less crowded.

It had a nice thin crispy top skin layer. The salmon was fresh and juicy, it flaked apart beautifully. The fennel salad paired well. I didn't care too much for the black lentils.\n\nWarm sticky toffee (dessert): 4.5\/5\nOmg definitely plan on sharing this dessert - the cake is HUGE! It is warm and drizzled in toffee, with a scoop of ice cream on top. The cake itself is not too sweet (made with dates!) and the toffee drizzle gives it it's sweetness. I'm a sucker for toffee so this was amazing. I kind of wish the scoop of ice cream was bigger though, definitely wasn't enough ice cream to cake ratio because the cake was so big!\n\nService: 5\/5\nMy server Nick did a great job of explaining the dishes and giving me good recommendations on what I should try.

Like most of the Vegas strip, expect a high price tag.  This restaurant has the added benefit of being themed after The television show \"Hell's Kitchen\".  We went for lunch so understand my review is based on that visit. \n\nThis restaurant had a surprisingly casual atmosphere for lunch. It looked like a dinner it would be more formal. We liked the casual atmosphere and the service was really good.\n\nThe food was excellent. We had the beef Wellington a fillet a few of the appetizers and a few of the sides. We also had every different dessert they sell.  All really good. It is a little expensive and for my family of five we spent $400 on lunch.\n\nThe only complaint we had was when we went to say hello to the celebrity chef Michelle.  As longtime fans of the show we were excited to meet her.  The waiter asked if we wanted to meet her and we were really happy to do it.  When we walked over to be introduced she was clearly frustrated.  We tried to make small talk and it was clear that she was not having a good day.  The interaction was so bad that it dropped my review from five stars to four and almost three.   If the food was not so good we would have given it a three.  \n\nOverall I would recommend this restaurant as a onetime visit if you are a fan of the show.  It is great if you are staying at ceasears. It is really convenient and I bet it would be a great high end dinner.  I just hope that Michelle is having a better day.","date":"2018-06-18 03:44:28"}
