I found Taco Naco on Yelp & was surprised with how simple, organized, straight forward & prompt everything was. I inquired to feed 80 people & paid about $500-$600 for it. This includes tortillas, Asada, chicken, al pastor, chips, guac, tomatillos, limes, cheese, grilled veggies, the food warmers, serving utensils, paper goods (plates\/forks\/napkins), & aluminum containers you don't have to return. All were high quality from the plastic bowls to the ripe limes and moist flavorful meats. They came right on time as requested & I paid in person upon delivery. One disappointing area was that I felt like there wasn't enough cheese or sour cream, but too much tortillas. The cheese\/sour cream ratio compared to the amount of tacos made wasn't enough. I would've traded all the leftover tortillas for more cheese or sour cream (HA). Anyways, I recommend Taco Naco!","date":"2016-11-11 18:11:56"}

There was considerable effort and pride when packing this food up. Anything that was needed, was included and thought of. The serving utensils were all high quality and professionally presentable. We hosted a Bday party at the Aria sky suites, so drop off was quick and needed to be timed perfectly. Via txt communication we were able to nail the drop off perfectly. I tipped the bell man pretty well, to bring up all the food to the suite. It worked out perfect all and all.

At $6\/head, it is one of the most affordable options I found. For this price, we got chicken, carne asada, and al pastor, pinto beans, rice, and sauteed veggies, plus corn and flour tortillas, 3 kinds of salsa, guacamole, and fixings like cilantro and lime. Plus a bag of chips. SO MUCH FOOD and all of it DELICIOUS. I paid extra for chafing dishes to keep the food warm, and that was great so that no one had to eat lukewarm meat. They were on time (within the 30 minute range of time they gave me) and efficient and quick with the setup. Would hire again, recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican catering. \n\n**one last note, they provided tongs and serving spoons and a few eating utensils, but they were small and not very useful so you'll probably want to bring your own. At $6\/head, I didn't even expect utensils and implements so it was fine.","date":"2016-06-13 21:14:08"}

The food was just okay.  I've had better.  I got the vegetarian burrito and he got the carne asada.  I tired his burrito as well.  Both burritos were extremely small in comparison to other quality burritos.  Think--half the size of a chipotle burrito.  The vegetarian burrito was flavorless and the carne asada had flavor but was nothing special.  The burrito was priced at $6 which is standard but not for the size obtained.  They ran out of onions and bell peppers for the vegetarian burrito.  This would have been fine, except I stopped in a few weeks ago to get a burrito and they ran out of beans and rice!  Odd--they sound like they are always running out of ingredients.  One thing that is surprising is that guac and sour cream come standard in the burrito.  \n\nThis was a one time stop for us!
