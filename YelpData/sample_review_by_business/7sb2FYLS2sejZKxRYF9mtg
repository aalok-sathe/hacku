By the looks of seeing this place on Yelp their photos looks deceiving. I just love it when sushi places gives little portions of rice for their nigiri. Usually I always order nigiri and maybe just one roll when I come for ayce. Anyways i tried this place and to me it's very delicious I love it here. Fresh servings of tuna and salmon are great.

Each piece of roll was not that big so it makes it easier to try more variety of rolls. We had a large party of 10 + 2 kids and they gave us the room to the front that was walled off to the side. That accommodated us perfectly! It was Friday night too at 7pm and we were seated pretty much right away! \nThe waitress- Raynee?- was very sweet and attentive to us. She even offered to split the check into two separate ones to make it easier for us. They also didn't make a big deal about several people in the party not getting the AYCE but only getting a teriyaki plate. \nThere were so many rolls to choose from. Yeah, the sushi was not the freshest I've tasted in my life, but was pretty good quality and I like the small cuts so it's not too filling. The skewers were really small and I think it was limited to one piece per. There were also a few other items on the menu which are limited to one per person. Next time I'm visiting Vegas, I'd return with several people again so we can try a more variety of rolls!","date":"2014-08-10 20:33:39"}

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1\/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.  The quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate.","date":"2015-07-16 06:55:28"}

WHY ME!?\" \n\nSo I didn't actually say that, but THAT'S HOW I FELT after eating here when everybody else apparently had the time of their lives. We rolled in on a Friday night and saw the below - \n\n+ Party of a lot of people in the dining room. OK, a crowd is a good sign.\n+ Seats at the sushi bar. On a Friday night with no wait? I'll take it. \n+ Huge fish to rice ratio. That's my attempt at \"low carb.\" \n\nWe sat down at the sushi bar and our server came by with our drinks pretty quickly, and we hit the ground running with our orders. At this point in the story, it's important to note that on a Friday night with a massive group that took up half of the restaurant, there were only two sushi chefs. Not for the sushi bar. I mean, for the whole place. \n\nI gave them the benefit of the doubt for the first few orders because I knew that a group of that size could definitely put a dent in the operation. But after our requests kept getting sidetracked time after time, it became frustrating as we saw our orders get plated with more focus on the presentation than the service speed...only to see it get served to someone else. This was on top of the fact that a few of our orders were also \"lost\" - not just at the sushi bar, but in the kitchen too. Those bulgogi nachos that I finally mustered up the courage to try? I'll never know how they tasted because they never hit the table. \n\nEhh, so maybe this was an isolated incident - I can see that happening. I'm willing to give it another shot, but with so many other AYCE sushi options available around town, it's going to be a while before I swing by again.","date":"2013-10-24 04:22:55"}

The set up of the restaurant and the menu has changed over time and it's completely amazing! The lunch is 21.95 up until 3pm and dinner price is around 25-26 which is usually the standard to most sushi places here. \n\nService\nALWAYS CONSISTENT. The workers here are very fast with refilling waters and clearing out the dishes on the table every time I come here. The sushi chefs prepare the sushi at a good amount of time so expect your sushi to be at your table within a few minutes. Completely never have to worry about waiting so long from my experience with anything at this place!\n\nFood\nThe fish to ratio on their rolls and especially their nigiri is a COMPLETE WIN! I can honestly tell you that you will not be disappointed in the ratio. The fish is completely fresh and it just melts in your mouth. \n\nThey are very good with their nigiri. Super white tuna and garlic tuna is definitely a must. The flavors on both nigiri work so well together. It completely melts in your mouth. If you're an unagi fan just as much as I am, you must order unagi here! The best one I've had so far. The chefs warm it up to perfection along with the rice and also to top it off, they glaze it with some kind of simple sweet sauce. I am completely drooling just explaining this. It's a MUST try!\n\nTheir appetizers are very good too. Bulgogi nachos, anything tempura there is hecka good. Whoever is battering it and cooking the tempura is doing it right! Hamachi Kama is very good too especially when you add some lemon juices to it. Baked green mussels... Wow, so much flavor. Can definitely inhale that every time I'm here and pork belly! Oh my god. Super tender and flavorful. \n\nThe rolls are very good too from what I've tried. I definitely need to expand more with rolls. The no name roll, Lisa Lisa, wet dream (if you like cream cheese), and Japanese lasagna is usually what I get. If you can't finish a full, you can actually order half rolls!\n\nReason why I rate this a 5 is because they've been so consistent with service since day 1! The chef is super nice along his staff.

I'll gladly take it over most buffets on the Strip any day. \n\nCame for dinner and at the sushi bar. I was served pretty quickly. Perhaps not the most friendliest of staff but they were great at getting food to me efficiently. With the slightly pricier dinner, you get single orders of a couple of exclusive items like sashimi salad and uni nigiri for example. They were of of the latter the night I went but I still had my fill on a variety of fresh nigiri. I thought the ratio of fish to rice was surprisingly decent. Also tried their highly recommended \"The Shit\" appetizer and it was alright but fans of deep fried items dipped in sweet creamy sauces might like this a lot. Loved the sashimi salad with all the big chunks of fresh fish in a bright dressing. \n\nIn the end, I enjoyed the items that I really wanted to eat and nothing else. Glad I ventured out to satisfy my tourists' gluttony.","date":"2016-06-22 23:05:54"}

So even though Sakana has its days when it's super amazing. Sometime I shake my head and wonder wth is going on. Today I have officially been eating here consistently for over a year. I just met the third owner of Sakana and am wondering how is it that she co-owns this place and was puzzled when I asked for half rolls... the manager was in a panic the entire time and somehow we got someone else's roll, and jacob didn't get half of this order. Do NOT try the wasabi taco. It is soooooo Gross. And apparently week day service is absolute shit. To add to that, the only reason why we got a table so quickly is because the couple got up and left since they hadn't been serviced yet. Did I mention it took my boyfriend 25 minutes to get his credit card back. \n\n\n\n\n-------\nI rarely give high reviews. But I really like this place. My boyfriend and I come here all the time, at least 3 times a month. This place is really well priced for what they have. \n\n$23-25 all you can eat sushi, including drinks, appetizers and desserts. \n\nAs far as the quality of the sushi, it's not fantastic but pretty good. \n\nThe only downside I would have to say is, don't experiment too much. I love trying different things but usually end up regretting most of my choices. The appetizer, \"the shit\" is probably the best experimental item on the menu.\n\nYou may have to wave down the server a few times to order unless you sit at the bar, you only have to wave them down for non roll items","date":"2017-04-07 23:18:45"}

A friend I work with introduced me to Sakana a few months ago and we decided to eat here again on NYE, calling it the best last meal of the year.  I've never really cared for AYCE sushi places and usually can't put away a huge quantity of food in one sitting.  So on the rare occasions I go this route I'm usually depending on the help of my gluttonous dining partners.  The nice thing about this menu is anything goes, it includes the rolls, nigiri, sashimi, appetizers, dessert, the entire thing. The only thing separate is the drink.  \n\nWe got the towering sashimi poke, sooo gooooood, we ordered a couple more.  Also consumed: pork belly, chicken curry, salmon collar thing I forgot what it's called,  green tea panna cotta, red bean ice cream, black sesame blanc manger, green tea ice cream.... The following double order of nigiris: salmon belly with fresh wasabi, super white tuna (in some awesome sauce I can only imagine is awesomesauce and\/or has crack in it), and 300 albacore.\n\nWe ate and ate and ate, it was terrible, it was good.  And the sushi chef Dragon is a badass.  He's hilarious, fast, and my friend notified him of my mango allergy and he was careful to make sure nothing killed me.  When the first towering sashimi poke rolled out, it had mango on it and Dragon remembered my allergy, pulled the plate, and got us another, safer, one.

It did, however, get busy around 7pm. So be there earlier if you don't want to wait for a table. The food was delicious. I did try the lasagna and the The Shit appetizers as others said they were delicious, and they were! The chanel roll was delicious as well. For one beer and all-you-eat dinner, I paid about $35. More than most sushi places. Overall, the food was good and the menu was huge. There are so many options; however, by the end of the dinner my stomach was growling and doing gymnastics. After a 25 minutes drive home, I went to the bathroom, not good.  One of my friends said her stomach was hurting too, but didn't go to the bathroom. Another one said her stomach was hurting all night, and was on the toilet all morning. One other friend said she was fine. We think it was this red \"spicy\" sauce that was on some of the rolls like Captain America and Burn Your ass, i think it was. It was more of a honey chili sauce to me. My friend said it was very ketchupy. Take that as you will.  It was overall good, and I think i'd go again, if I have to. Definitely not my first choice because of getting sick, but I'd like to think maybe it was a one-time thing.","date":"2015-12-05 19:13:44"}

I'd drive through here for dinner or make the trip though I live a ways away haha. I brought some coworkers here and it's become a favorite lunch spot as we work near by on the strip for 20.95.\n\nSakana has almost ruined me for other sushi spots, with the exception of Neko, which I suspect is under the same ownership\/ management, overall very similar rolls. Their sauce combinations and spiciness have left me a bit unsatisfied, as if their ingredients are missing, from other places. They have a wide variety of fish options and offer an extended menu of rice less options during dinner $25.95\n\nThis little local Vegas gem brings some serious AYCE competition, one of the best. They usually have a wait but I've never waited too long whether I sit with coworkers at lunch or I sit at the bar, chefs are quick too. The roll and appetizer variety is plentiful, they offer exclusive dinner menu specials which is totally worth the dinner price. They offer a good selection of rice less rolls and options. They aren't thinly sliced on the fish, which I love about their nigiri, and their sauces are always just the right amount to complement the flavor.","date":"2017-05-13 19:02:30"}

However, this is one of the few places you can fill up without using the AYCE.

They're kinda heavy on the mayo here so read the description of the rolls if you're not up for that kind of richness lol like the monkey brains had a LOT of mayo. That with the mushy bananas was definitely not one of our favorite rolls lol we finished our meal with a great green tea panna cotta and the mini honey toast. We also tried their ice creams.

With finishing up my Goyemon stamp card, I now feel like I have the freedom to eat whatever sushi spot I please without having the feeling of \"oh that could have been another stamp to fill before my card expiration date\" feeling. \n\nWith that said, I think Sakana should take up punch cards! I mean don't get me wrong, Goyemon is great, but it's the power of the punch card and the idea that I could get a free meal soon that kept me tied to the place for so long. Oh and the fact that they basically set a deadline to receive your free meal.\n\nI really enjoyed my 2nd visit to Sakana. I definitely saw lots of improvements in the menu, although they were minor, they still made a big impact. For example, the subtle garnishes they add on different nigiri. My absolute favorite is the super white tuna topped with sea salt and shredded nori. I couldn't believe the huge taste difference with such a small added detail. Also, the small pieces of ikura added on to salmon belly nigiri were on point! I received complimentary hamachi sashimi pieces from the chef. I was absolutely grateful for it, but the pieces were still a bit frozen and hard to chew through. That was sort of disappointing. However everything else definitely made up for it. \n\nThey now provide a menu sheet that you can mark on, which is great! I go a little crazy at sushi restaurants and it's hard to remember exactly what I want for the first order -- there's lots of fish names swimming around in my head. It really helps me and the server that I can just mark down what I want per order. \n\nThere were lots of presentation improvements too. I like that they added a leaf garnish (?) between the plate and your order. It makes for a great food photo op :) However, I feel like they still need to work on the interior design of the restaurant. They had scrolls of cloth sectioning off the tables that had messaging scribbled on with what looked like a crayon. It just doesn't represent the quality of their food well. I noticed behind the sushi chefs they had vertical rectangular sheets of paper hanging all over the walls that I would assume represents Japanese custom of a menu (like Ichiza). If they could set the ambiance and decor as a traditional chic sushi restaurant, this place would be perfection. Like if Kabuto and Ichiza had a restaurant baby, I would hope it would be what Sakana looked like. \n\nBut the important thing really is the food selection. Still a big fan of their large cut nigiri pieces! This place will definitely be my go-to spot for my next few sushi fixes.","date":"2013-10-24 18:39:40"}

We were seated about ten minutes later. \n\nThe decor in this place is a little confusing. The ambiance is that of a college dorm, with chalk board walls and beer signs.

The place is unorganized when it comes to service, they kept bringing the wrong rolls to the table next to us.\n\nThe food was decent.

This was the younger, non-asian server... don't care that he's not asian, but not sure if it was the age or maturity level that let him be so lacksadaisacal about our table. \n\nWe had another server, Sunny who later picked up our table who was GREAT. He was always coming around our table, making sure our water was filled, clearing our plates etc. However, the first server left a bad taste in my mouth.","date":"2014-10-28 03:42:28"}

Yes it isn't as great as what you'd get in an omakase or an izakaya, but for an AYCE, this was hands-down one of the best fish I have been served. Oh and for the very competitive price, you also get access to some super \"rare\" items such as salmon belly, ocean trout nigiri, uni, and more. For you sushi newbies, these items are considered commodities and usually will cost you quite the penny if bought alone. Go ask how much two pieces of salmon trout nigiri costs at another sushi restaurant! But here it's included in the AYCE!

We pretty much tasted all the standard fare with a few exceptions like the salmon skin hand roll which was different than any I had tasted in the past. It was a tad sweet which made it taste unique but really good. We also ended up having 1 of each of the desserts and I think my favorite was the black sesame manger.

We came in for lunch and sat up at the bar with Chef Sai who is very personable and funny, yet passionate about his sushi. We had called ahead of time and asked what the difference between the lunch price ($20.95) and the dinner price ($22.95) was...they don't offer some items at lunch as they do for dinner so just do yourself a favor and go all in, pay the dinner price, and KILL IT!!!!\n\nAppetizers, Rolls, Nigiri, Dessert....besides the standard one per person Uni and Amaebi(which automatically comes with a fried head) As much as you want, as much as you can put away-half rolls too, so you can try different ones the fish quality was great,(Of course, the top tier fish are found at Kabuto, Yonaka, and Yummy Grill at W Lake Mead) and I especially like that for the Uni nigiri, you get the entire roe! That is something that Chef Sai is proud about, and from him being able to select the ingredients straight from the source, that's what allows him to charge these amazingly low prices.\n\nThe fish to rice ratio is pretty awesome too. I'd say he uses no more than oh.......about 50 grains of rice per nigiri, so you can enjoy the fish without the rice overkill. Everything we had was very tasty! Sakana also offers a good variety of appetizers, salads, and other side dishes that are worth a try too. Chef Sai has definitely done his homework and dined at the competitors around town to see how he can stand out from the rest of them. Although we stuck mostly to nigiri and appetizers, we tried the Sashimi Roll which was very artfully  presented, and was very delicious. Chef Sai also gave us a Pink Scallop that was in the shell and presented with mango salsa and ponzu which was on his specials board. I had room for half a roll more before dessert, so I asked Chef Sai to make me a half roll of anything he wanted to make it with, so it was shrimp tempura and crab in the center, wrapped with maguro and hamachi topped with red onion and ponzu\nI tried looking for it on the menu, but I couldn't find it...(it was a custom roll) \"Which one is this one?\" I asked. He replied  \"It's the which one is this one roll..LOL!!!\" Good times with Chef Sai!\n\nDesserts are pretty good here too. The Plum Ice Cream is delicious and so is the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. If we are ever in the area again and a craving hits, we will most definitely be back!   ALOHA!!!","date":"2013-10-04 03:44:57"}

They charge per can here and he swore that he put a certain number on the table even thought we showed him the empty cans that we had (only a few people had anything other than water) and then when we told him that we were told it was free refills (because we asked) he made us point out and call over the sever  who told us that information. SUPER AWKWARD.  it was a a $0.50 can of soda that he THINKS that he put at our table. We told him \"what do you want to see our purses? To prove we arent hiding another can\". it was a little ridiculous. Then when we were paying some of us just paid together to make it easier on him to not have to split so many checks (there were 6 of us) and then he came back to ask if we had all paid...like WTF?! First the soda then checking to make sure all the bills were paid instead of checking with the cashier.....I was done.

Parking was a bit tougher than in the old days of Kabuki Dining Bar (previous ownership) since there's now more places open in this small plaza. You can still see the old signage and the same layout from Kabuki, and there's still some of the old specialty desserts (green tea panna cotta, black sesame blanc manger). Everything else is different.\n\nThis place reminds me of Sushi Koma. It's kinda a Koma-lite if you live on this side of town and aren't trying to find sushi at 2 am or whatnot. Adorning nigiri with sauces and whatnot is reminiscent of Koma, and here they also have interesting appetizers including the crispy rice (loved it), the bulgogi nachos (careful with the cream cheese), and a recently added appetizer in red text (I won't type the name here because some might find it offensive).\n\nI wasn't told in advance that you place nigiri and roll orders on paper (may not be applicable to bar area seating). It's something I've only seen in California, never Vegas, but it actually does help you plan out your meal. You still verbalize order appetizers, specials, and desserts, so no worries there.\n\nI've started to find that some places will honor dinner prices (and therefore menus) at early hours, so I was also able to get the sashimi salad (really good), sashimi roll (wrapped in unobtrusive cucumber) and some of the dinner-only specials from the board including toro steak (basically seared and sauced), salmon belly (always welcome), and a white fish sashimi kinda thing that was pleasant (see pictures).\n\nThe biggest improvement over Kabuki (and vs. Koma, actually) is that Sakana does not limit you on dessert. I'm a big dessert guy, and I tried a little bit of almost everything. The sweet and smooth plum ice cream was the best, the mango mochi was as expected, and the black sesame blanc manger was a nice change of pace. I was disappointed that the green tea ice cream was a little lacking in flavor and was too icy compared to the plum as well as to a superior green tea ice cream at Goyemon.\n\nI can't really put my finger on why I didn't get the best impression from this visit. I enjoyed a lot of items, and I liked having the dinner specials for just $22.95 (vs. $20.95 lunch). Maybe it was the nigiri. The fish-to-rice ratio is great, but each piece didn't fill my mouth as much as I'm used to since the fish comes in long and thin slices. It could also be that I just hadn't built up enough of an appetite at lunchtime. Most likely, however, I'd say it was because I just had the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas twice this week, and that place just crushes Sakana in a direct competition. I'm willing to return here, and you should give this a try if you're an AYCE fan, but I prefer some of the other places just a little more.","date":"2013-10-05 08:19:01"}

Service was SLLLLOOOWWW.  It feels as if though they are short on servers.\n\nWhen he finally came back to ask for our order, of course I order uni, amaebi, then he stop me and said, \"We ran out of uni and amaebi. Let me go check.\"  Then he disappeared for a while.  When he came back, he handed us a sheet to order from and verified that they do not have uni and amaebi to order.\n\nSo I ordered items on the special menu (toro steak, salmon belly, white fish), saba, superwhite, salmon, scallops, salmon kama.  Server came back to let us know that they are out of salmon kama, how about Hamachi kama.  We said yeah that's cool.  He left and returned to let us know that they are also out of hamachi kama.\n\nFor the items that we did order, the only thing that tasted good was the salmon belly and toro steak.  Other items were doused with too much sesame oil, tasteless, or downright odd (the scallops tasted like they were previously cooked).\n\nSo at this point, I had given up on order anything else since I do not want to stuff myself with mediocre sushi.  Earl however, is eating for sustenance.  \n\nWe never, ever, order sushi rolls at AYCE.  But this night, Earl did.  He eat, just to eat.  We overheard another table said that they couldn't order chicken fried rice because they are out of it.  How they heck do you run out of chicken fried rice when your restaurant isn't even that busy?  We learned from another yelper that visited Sakana earlier that a health inspector came by earlier and service slowed down a lot.\n\nGuess that explains some parts to the evening, but what about mediocre sushi?\n\nConclusion:  Goyemon is still the best.  We will not return to Sakana.","date":"2013-10-05 16:15:16"}

Geoff loves seaweed salad and eats it whenever he gets the chance, he said it was pretty average,not the best,but not the worst, just average. the sashimi salad I did enjoy, it looks gorgeous, I love the presentation but it didn't blow my mind, but it was good for sure. the shit comes highly recommened it's fried, it has a yummy sauce, what's not to love. the dragon balls are mushrooms with lobster mix deep dried,very yummy. now, the Towering Sashimi Poke o...m..g! so good!!!!!!! it comes on a lil fried wonton chip with crab mix and some poke and a lil like salsa mix on top it's fresh and yummy definitely get the towering poke!we ordered it twice it was so good. the service was better this time than it has been for me in the past. other times I felt completely forgotten about as far as refills are concerned tonight was much better. still a couple times they almost gave us someone else's food, but it was quickly figured out and resolved,they were very busy with lots of servers and busers running around so I can see how a lil confusion can happen. next we got the sashimi roll, the summer crunch roll and the honey screaming O. I liked all of them my fav though was summer crunch, it's lobster mix deep fried with some other goodness, they are lil balls of heaven or as Geoff says \"a tasteplosion in my mouth\" the screaming O was different than I thought it would be from the other pics on yelp.it was good, but I was a lil disapointed that it wasn't what I expected.im still on the hunt for the one ive seen in other yelp pics.next we had the Chanel roll and the Be Happy roll. I really loved the Chanel, it has assorted fish on top, crab and tempura shrimp inside and screaming o sauce, it was yummy. our server also said it was his fav. by the time the be happy roll came I was so full lol! it was similar to chanel as far as sauce and assorted fish but it had fried soft shell crab inside instead of crab mix. this was the first time I have ever tried soft shell crab, it wasn't bad. it was a Lil chewy from the shell of the crab I think. it was different but it was good. finally we had the tempura ice cream, also a first for me it was pretty good. it's small so perfect to share after you are full of sushi lol. just a lil sweet treat to end the night. it had a funnel cakeiness to it that I liked. we actually ordered the summer crunch a second time, for the last round but it never came, we ended up being really full anyhow so we didnt say anything.i gotta say even though the service sometimes irritates me, I love sakana. they have so much to choose from and they are always coming up with new and interesting things. and they really take pride in presentation. the  Chanel roll and be happy were very pretty! i just wish they would tighten up their customer service a  little bit.like i had to ask for my first refill of ice tea, when he was right there when we ordered the 2nd round, my glass was empty but he didnt seem to notice, so i asked the next time he came back. and he did do it after that without asking (i drink a lot of ice tea lol), but I don't want to have to ask at all, especially if you are standing right there and my glass is empty, notice and offer a refill, it's why I am going to leave you a good tip. tonight was better than times before, but there is still room for improvement.i wish i could leave a 3.5 star thats really what i want to do.just  a star and a half to improve service a little bit. next up on my bookmark list is Yama sushi, close by sakana. I wanna see how they compare to each other. really I wanna find the best sushi spot in vegas, maybe it's sakana, maybe it's somewhere else , i dunno, but I am gonna find it lol.","date":"2015-08-31 05:33:13"}

Mainly because their nigiri is fresh and they don't stuff you with rice. For $25pp at dinner, I thought it was pretty reasonable and I ate a LOT. Their fish to rice ratio is as one of the other reviews says about 3:1. It definitely means you can eat more sashimi and less rice, which I appreciate. We ordered almost all the nigiri on the list for dinner and my favorite was probably the hamachi and yuzu hamachi. The seared salmon and eel werepretty good too. A lot of the rolls were also pretty good, but the rice there might fill you up a bit. I ordered a double dragon roll and someone else ordered one of the spicy rolls which were both delicious. The uni was actually pretty fresh when we got it compared to some other reviews and my friends liked the mussels and oysters. I'm just not a big mussel\/oyster person in general. We ordered everything off the list that we could only order once, but I thought they were just okay. \n\nWhat they did lack in was probably organization skills. We had to wait quite awhile to get seated and we were a little confused why a table of 3 who came after our party of 5 was asked to sit down first in a long bench area in the middle of their restaurant when we clearly could have been seated there. Luckily we didn't get seated too late after them as people were leaving, but that was a little annoying. Also one of the appetizers we ordered way early in the evening never got to us until the end of the meal even though we kept asking every time. \n\nAll in all, I would come back because I thought it was pretty worth it for all the fish and rolls we ate!","date":"2017-03-16 20:51:46"}

There was still one table available but the wait staff were quite busy and sat us almost 25 minutes later at the open table that was available the entire time. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ It took a few minutes to get water and menus and all three of us were going for AYCE sushi. I'd say every roll we ordered we thoroughly enjoyed. They were out of salmon kama and oysters which was a bummer. My favorite was the little tease roll, it had spicy tuna and cucumber inside and was topped with Cajun tuna, deep fried onion and jalapeño with spicy mayo, garlic ponzu and eel sauce. So effing delicious! My boyfriend had almost every nigiri on the menu and he was impressed with the rice to fish ratio, big portion of fish to rice! Nice! All the rolls were not stuffed with rice and we really did some damage and were not stuffed quickly as they give good portion of rice to fish in all their rolls. Service was lacking. We had to ask many times for water and had to fall down our waiters to order more rolls.

The latter are really good, but we wanted to try some place new. I decided to Yelp for an AYCE sushi place and stumbled on Sakana--boy am I glad that we did! Hands down one of the best AYCE in Vegas! Price for lunch AYCE IS $21.99 and dinner is $24.99.\n\nThe restaurant itself is located in a small plaza with ample parking, although it can get relatively full. The actual restaurant is quaint with cute japanese\/sea inspired decors inside. We were seated right away and first thing I noticed on the wall were the recommendations by the Chefs. I found this to be nice, specially since it was our first time going there and as like any new comers, we may need help picking either the most popular or the favorites of the Chefs.\n\nThe service itself was great. Never once did we have any empty water glasses and everyone was really nice and polite. The food came out pretty quickly as well, which was a plus.\n\nIn terms of the food, all the sushi and apppitizers we tried were delicious! I do recommend for the appetizers to try the pork belly, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and something called \"The Shit,\" which is a stuffed pepper with crab meat.\n\nFor the sushi, we tried the Golden Tiger, the Poki\/Crab Meat Nachos, the Monkey Brain, the Lemon Shrimp, the Albacore and the Yellowtail. Again, all were very tasty and fresh! Some of the flavor profiles will surprise you, like the Monkey Brain, which plays on the sweet and savory taste as it mixes sauteed banana with the California Roll. Sounds weird, I know, but it is absolutely delicious! \n\nI definitely would recommend everyone to try this place out! If you're an avid sushi fan or just looking for a nice Japanese restaurant to eat at, this place can cater to all. If you don't want the AYCE option, you can also just order per entree. Definitely a must try in Vegas!","date":"2015-12-06 08:07:49"}

Most AYCE sushi restaurants will give you a lot of rice and not so much protein, Sakana does the complete opposite, long and thick fillet of protein over a smaller bed of rice. Way more dessert options when buying the AYCE deal, fried bananas, tiramisu, mini honey toast,  tempura ice cream, which are all very small compare to regular dessert but by that time you should be stuffed ( or else you didn't do it right).

And for $25 for all you can eat (dinner from 3pm) it is a bargain. So if you find yourself in Hawaii's 9th island, make sure you make this a stop. You will not be disappointed","date":"2017-07-29 15:21:05"}

You can dine either al a carte or choose the all-you-can-eat (AYCE) option for a flat fee of $25. I highly recommend the AYCE option because about two rolls and a seaweed salad amounts to $25 so you might as well do the AYCE which includes  appetizers, sushi rolls, nigiri, and dessert. It is a small place so I recommend making a reservation for the weekends or going on a week day to avoid the crowds. Without a reservation I've waited as long as an hour for a table on a Friday night. It's a pretty intimate setting so it's great for date night  as well as dinner with a small group of friends. Again if dining with more than 5 people I would recommend making a reservation. \n\nAppetizers - They by far have the best seaweed salad in town! I have a few staples I order every time which include edamame, baked mussels, cucumber salad, seafood salad, and \"the shit\" (trust me, you'll love it). \n\nRolls - I haven't had a roll I didn't like yet. The fish quality is great but my favorites are the Chanel Roll, Sashimi Roll (instead of rice its rolled in cucumber) , Rainbow Roll, White Vegas Snow and Jackpot Roll.\n\nNigiri - They have a great fish to rice ratio! They give you huge pieces of fish and it's so fresh. I recommend the salmon and yellowtail.\n\nDessert - I ordered the coffee mochi and it was really dry as if it was old. I do definitely recommend their red bean ice cream if they have it.","date":"2017-07-19 23:38:28"}

This restaurant opened just about two months ago according to the chef, and they still have the old signage of Kabuki outside so it was slightly challenging finding this place.  I'm glad I persevered and found it or I would have missed one hell of a treat!  Ayce lunch here goes for $20.95, not the cheapest but definitely well worth it!\n\nI was able to sample the majority of their nigiri and just one roll.  Their nigiri is top notch, subjectively better than Yama's, Goyemon's, and Daisho's (my former top three for nigiri in an ayce).  The way they cut the fish is different in that the fish is extra long (see the pics), which makes for an awesome fish to rice ratio.  Many of the nigiri comes dressed with an appropriate sauce and is truly yummy!\n\nI suppose the nigiri purists out there may not like \"pre-saucing\" that much but how they did it here is just right imho.  I guess you can always ask for no sauce if that's your fancy.  The singular roll I had (something's wrong roll) was awesome too.  I also had a cup of miso soup, an order of seaweed salad, and the green tea panna cotta, which were good but didn't really stand out.\n\nI wish I didn't come here by myself so that I could have sampled more items as I can only eat so much alone.  They have a bunch of appetizer and dessert items that I would have loved to try.  I found out after my meal that I could have ordered half rolls so I'll try that next time.  In summary, Sakana is a new Japanese staffed sushi bar that serves awesome sushi with a modern twist.","date":"2013-10-05 18:24:19"}

I haven't had AYCE sushi in years and years. Most places' menus are heavy on the rolls (sauced up and fried usually) but Sakana has loads of options, many nigiri sushi to choose from and tons of apps. We didn't even put a dent in the menu! There's so much I wanted to try but was too full to get to. Next time!\n\nThe service was quick even though the place was packed. There was a short wait for a table but not bad. Dinner was $25.95 and if you can eat at least two rolls on your own (I mean who can't?) then the AYCE option is worth the price.\n\nAwesome rice to fish ratio--I know that's important, esp cheap asses like me who want to get their money's worth (even though my dining companion treated me LOL). They do only allow one order of each for certain items, namely uni, amaebi, oyster, and salmon belly (I think). The uni was hit or miss. A couple pieces were really nice and sweet. The others not so much. Also the fried heads of the amaebi had too thick of batter and the head itself didn't taste so fresh (again, one was good, the other not).\n\nThe hamachikama (collar) was tiny and kinda fishy. Not what I'm used to. But there were plenty of items that were great and we got multiples of. The unagi was one of my faves. \n\nThe staff are very attentive since they want a fast turn over rate. They don't make you sit there and digest your food so you can eat less. They just let you order how ever much you want, and clear plates quickly. And as soon as your table is starting to get bare, they come and take another order.\n\nAre there more authentic and higher quality places in town? Sure. But for the price, this is probably as good as you are going to get.","date":"2017-08-09 16:39:56"}

Some were a little too soaked which made them a difficult to eat and over powered the dish. \n\nThe restaurant was clean and the decor was modern and fun! The walls are covered with cool art, big chalk boards with colorful chalk and a plank wood tree climbing up one of the walls into the ceiling. Did I mention Hello Kitty was the decor in the women's restroom? Any girl would love that. It has an all around Japanese Hipster feel.

We were immediately seated at the sushi bar (there was a short wait for a table).  Funky, roomy interior, fun decor, and $25.95 for AYCE.  Everything on the menu.  They did stress that if you 'overordered' and did not consume things you could be charged extra.  Taking their advice we ordered moderately.\nOrdered mostly nigiri, and one spider roll which was beautifully presented on a wooden platter.  The tobiko was a delightul rainbow of 3 colors.  Also the shrimp tempura, seaweed salad (best I've had in long time), miso soup (meh), and the menu labeled 'must try' \"The Shit\".  Wasnt impressed by \"The Shit\" so I wouldnt recommend it.  I just like typing that.  We'll see if Yelp lets it thru.\nThere were ALOT of servers but I think they could work on their coordination better, we waited several minutes between orders, and waiting for ordering dessert was close to 8-10 minutes. \nEverything was fresh and enjoyable, nicely presented, servers were polite, friendly.  And the price, well about as low as I've seen for good quality.  Probably gonna make this our regular AYCE place when we come to town.","date":"2016-03-09 16:30:05"}

In the parking lot, I found that everyone else I encountered had their meal comped and were talking about where else to go eat. It's an AYCE restaurant, and most probably did not eat that much. The staff wisely started packing up the fish to put on ice. \n\nWe all sat in the same hot restaurant while the staff figured out what to do. That place heated up quickly (again, not their fault but I endured what everyone else did). I paid and sat outside yelping for an idea of what to do next and heard from the only other three parties in the restaurant that they had been comped while we were making small talk about what had happened.  I guess whoever was running that shift didn't want to make anymore pencil rubbings of credit cards after the mess of making mine. \n\nI know life's not fair, but damn.

So many places barely put a sliver of fish so that's a welcome surprise. They customer service was great. The servers are always making sure you're good to go, whether it's beer or water or more rolls. The rolls Come out quick. It was almost too quick because I expected them to take longer so I had a table full of rolls-a good problem to have. The chefs are fun to converse with, which is an underrated part of sushi experience when eating at a bar. An outgoing chef changes the entire vibe. Their fresh Wasabi is straight (fire emojis).

I've been searching for the perfect sushi spot for years and I think I've finally found it.  \n\nYour best bet to go is for dinner, I've tried their lunch ayce and it did not compare.  The winners are definitely the one per person dinner items.  Their uni is probably the freshest & sweetest I've tried at an ayce joint.  I love how small their rice portions are, it's the perfect rice to sashimi ratio.  Some of my favorite things include D's Guys Roll, Something Wrong Roll, Baked Mussels, Pork Belly, and Super White Tuna nigiri.  And their monthly specials located on the blackboard have been heaven in my mouth!  Be sure to check it out.\n\nI've gone probably about six times now and with each visit, it gets better.  They try different sauces to top of their Towering Sashimi Poki and other items.  I've noticed they've been changing their menu up by adding Pork Belly and new appetizers as well.  \n\nDesserts are also unlimited!  They offer tempura ice cream, deep fried banana, black sesame manger, green tea panna cotta, mochi, and ice cream.  The manger and panna cotta have the consistency of creme brûlée minus the caramelized top.  Try them all and find your new favorite.  I always end the night with plum wine ice cream.  \n\nThe only downside is that they don't have fountain sodas, so no refills... and hot tea is not free either.

Mouthwatering quality! \n\nThese are what dreams are made of:\n- Salmon nigiri (My salmon addict tongue is happy) \n- Salmon belly nigiri (Heaven on earth buttery sweetness)\n- Yellowtail belly nigiri (You had me at belly!) \n- Uni nigiri (Eyes rolling to the back of your head in pure enjoyment, yup sounds exactly right) \n- Ama ebi (It was ginormous!) \n- Albacore with garlic ponzu nigiri (My inner sauce whore was loving the garlic ponzu, also the albacore was bu-tter-yyyyyyy!)\n- Yuzu yellowtail nigiri (Give us 4 orders stat! Love this refreshing nigiri) \n- Baked green mussels (They've mastered the baked green mussel here. Delicious!!!)\n- Tower of sashimi poke (love the crisp wonton chip and the explosive flavors!)\n- Japanese nachos (kind of like the tower of sashimi poke and it's really addicting!)\n- Karai Sashimi (like a dry seasoned poke.

Pairs great with all of their nigiri. \n--and so much more! I don't have enough room in my tummy to try everything all at once, so I'm always making a list of a what to get next time I come. \n\nService was even better than last time we were here (I didn't think that was possible). They quickly went out of their way to give us everything we wanted and then some. Our server is always this cute petite asian woman and she is so sweet and always makes sure everything we need we get right away! Even the sushi chef Dragon visits our table to politely let us know our baked items will be out soon (we weren't even waiting long for them) - what a stand-up guy! He is super friendly and hysterical! We always get a kick out of his silly personality.

The white tuna was pretty good, soft and fresh. The hamachi yellowtail was also a favorite. We didn't order many rolls because the nigiri was pretty filling and fresh. The dessert selection was amazing and we were very happy with the honey toast with ice cream. \n\nService was great, drinks refilled regularly.  The menu was extensive and has tons of choices.

Checking on Yelp, I saw they have over 1400 reviews at 4.5 stars, so that was enough for me to round up a gang of 8 for an early dinner. \n\nWe arrived around 3:30ish, missing the lunch cut-off, so each had to pay an extra 5 bucks. \nLunch: $20.95\nDinner: $25.95\n\nThe place was half full. The decor was busy and some replica vintage items rest on shelves for an added touch. The ayce menu had many items and can be overwhelming, especially when the server has an impatient look on her face everytime she came by to tke our order. We were handed a sheet to mark our orders, but no explanations were given that even though the paper only lists round 1 & 2, we can actually order more if needed. \n\nA few of us wanted hot water (because it was cold and it's better for digestion) but we were told they don't have hot water, only hot tea @ $1.50 \/ cup. Really? What do you use to make hot tea if you don't have hot water?? \n\nWe ordered some sodas, and they brought out the wrong ones, so we had to flag another server down to have that corrected. \n\nThe rolls and nigiri we ordered were good, for the most part. (see my photos) The uni was subpar. It was runny, pale in color and had a weird texture, as if it's been dunked in water. \n\nThe freshwater eel was the highlight, as it tasted fresh w\/ a semi-sweet sauce drizzled over it. We ordered some extra plates of this. \n\nThe food selection, flavor and portions (fish to rice ratio) earns them a 4, or even 4.5 for a few in our party, but the whole experience of dining there dropped it down. \n\nLet me explain: \n* After our first round was finished, no one ever came by to hand us an additional order sheet, menu or even ask if we needed anything. I had to go up to the cashier and grab it myself ... repeatedly.\n* The music selection was annoying. K-pop (Korean pop music) was blasting above our heads. This is obviously targeting a certain market, not the majority. \n* Though I saw many kids in there, they played music videos with skanky girls in string bikinis shaking their thang. Maybe it's a Vegas thing but not really approriate for kids, no? \n* A few of the servers were pleasant, but a couple of them plain looked pissed off whenever we asked for something. Perhaps they should work at DMV, they will fit right in. \n\nWill we come back? No, not again as a big group. Though the food was pretty good, their lack of patience and explanation for first timers didn't sit well with me. In addition, lying to us about not having hot water and forcing us to pay for hot tea (which tasted like colored water) did not set a good impression for management, and also the annoying loud teenie bopper music selection didn't make for a comfortable dining environment, as we had trouble carrying on  conversations. \n\nFood: solid 4+\nAmbience\/ Service: 2\nAvg: 3","date":"2017-01-03 00:44:39"}

The experience wasn't as great as some of the other people rating on here for several reasons:\n\nWe got more orders of the same thing than we actually ordered. For example, if we ordered 1 order of Golden California Roll, we would get 2. This happened more than once. And when we asked the server about it, she told us that we in fact did order (but when she let us see our order paper, it wasn't even marked). There were also orders we did that we never received. I am not sure what was the issue since we split our group into two separate ordering parties, it shouldn't have been that confusing!\n\nAny roll that would generally taste sweet, were way too sweet here. Left us wondering if it's a Japanese restaurant styled to cater to American sweet tooth. The raw sushi also wasn't as good or as fresh as one of the sushi joints I frequent in California either (@ a fraction of the price). Like, the salmon LOOKED fatty, but it didn't...taste fatty.\n\nWeird experience for me.","date":"2018-02-03 04:23:25"}

It's my go to sushi place if Yama Sushi's full because it's across the street anyway. It's also near UNLV so I'm about it when I'm around campus and craving quality sushi. It's a 5 star place for me but I have to give it 4 because the last time I came here, it was a quick get in and get out sushi session due to one of their air conditioning was down so it was a little warm, especially during the summer! I usually like staying in sushi bars long for a good intellectual conversation, but I was saddened by this one time experience. \n\nIt's okay though because I'll update on this the next time I go and see if it's improved by then.\n\nThe waiters\/waitresses were decent and took our orders quickly. The chefs (at the bar) were always aware of our orders and got them to us quickly as well, even when it was busy.\n\nI'd have to say the sushi was fresh and impressively portioned. I don't like having that much rice in my nigiri but they definitely go the portioning perfect! Big fresh fish cuts on a good enough amount of rice! I'm into nigiris so it was pretty bomb compared to other sushi places! I just wished they had wasabi and ginger prepared without asking, and also a personal plate to put your sushi on\n\nI'm also a fan of their authentic Japanese decor. It's cute and relaxing, just good enough for a sushi restaurant. The area was clean as well as their bathroom. and there was enough space to get around so it doesn't feel too crowded and close together.\n\nIf you're looking for some good quality sushi and service, this place is a good spot! It's around the corner from target on Maryland and Flamingo (also near Tiabi Waffles). It's a private parking lot so it shouldn't be hard to find a parking space unless the restaurants are packed.\n\nOverall, great place but I wished they'd fixed their air conditioning.","date":"2015-08-09 07:02:23"}

Not too much rice and the fish is pretty fresh. They put WAY too much sauce on the rolls so next time I go, I plan on ordering the sauce on the side. I got the popcorn lobster roll and it was drenched in 3 different sauces (one seemed to be just plain mayo-gross) and it kind of ruined the flavor of the roll and turned it into a goo-ey mess. I would say the $25.99 AYCE option is a great deal if you get the nigiri and no-rice plates (available only at dinner) since they give you a generous cut of fish and not too much rice. The rolls are big and quite rich so they fill you up fast. I went in starving and could not finish the 2 rolls I ordered. (I also had eaten 2 pieces of salmon sushi). My total would have been $27 if I had just ordered a la carte so I didn't really get to take advantage of the AYCE price but next time I come back, I'll be sticking to just the nigiri, sashimi salad and a hand rolls.","date":"2016-03-19 03:48:28"}

They might limit you to one or two order for a few delicacies but you can have Nigiri all you want... and it is mostly what I had. The food was good ans the service attentive. They are in fact very generous on the fish portion for the Nigiris.

I gave this place another shot because I did not have a choice, to be honest. Last night me and my coworkers, party of 15 ,were planning on going to a new sushi joint, Gorilla sushi, but apparently they were so jam packed they had to close for the night. So I called Yama sushi to make a quick reservation but they had no availability for party of 15. So I ended up calling Sakana and luckily they were able to take us.  \n\nWe went in and our server greeted us. He seemed very nice. Although I do not know his name in fact he never introduced himself, all I know is that he is an asian guy. So we started ordering by checking off the sushi menu. The server asked us if we want any appetizers and we ordered some. And he took that sheet of paper that we ordered. We waited about good 30 minutes for our nigiris and sushi rolls to come out. Appetizers came out quick so that was good. Overall their appetizers were okay. I ordered a mini udon it was so salty I could not even finish it. Finally our orders came and of course there were a lot of orders. First round about 40-50 orders of nigiris came out. I actually did not get my sushi at that time but I could not wait I was so hungry I had to eat some of my coworkers. I had a garlic tuna nigiri and it was not fresh at all. I was a bit disappointed by the quality of fish. \n\nMy orders did not come so I patiently waited and was expecting that other nigiris are better. And when our server brought our orders and he literally said, \"You guys are ordering way too much!!! It's like 50 rolls and a bunch of other orders!!\" We were all like WTF???? Hello? Don't you know that there are 15 of us and of course there is gonna be tons of orders. I was dumbfounded. It's not like 4 people ordering tons there are 15 PEOPLE dude!! Also he made faces when he said that. I get his point but they way he said it was not pleasant and unprofessioanal. He could have just said nicely. It almost seemed like he has two faces. At first he greeted us with a smile and now he's bitc*ing at us. Haha! What kind of service are you providing? I started to get very annoyed as I was STILL waiting for my order. However, our server brought us wrong orders several times. Then that ticked some of us off. Half of my party started complaining about their orders have not came out, some said 2\/3 of their orders some said half of their orders were missing. To be honest, at that time we all patiently waited and waited. I wanted to complain to their manager but I did not want to ruin our night. So I let it go this time. But I did reordered my uni nigiris it took them another 15 minites so I finally got my order. As soon as I looked at uni I could tell it was almost going bad. The color was almost yellowish brown and the texture was foamy. I got so grossed out by just looking at it. So I just dumped all of them inside the miso soup. I know I should not be doing that but I thought they deserve it because I did not want to get sick. I had a bad experience with uni nigiris so I know I can tell if they are fresh or not.\n\nI understand the restaurant's point of view where a bunch of people ordering so many different things at once or whatever but you cannot treat customers like that. He talked down to us as if we were pigs or something. Also, I would have given another star if their food were decent and they were not. I really don't get the hype here. You can go to many other sushi places, seriously. A lot of us ended up tipping him less than normal. I gave him around 3 bucks for my check. Some of my coworkers gave him 1 buck, lol.\nI think they deserve less tips. Today at work we talked about what happened last night and we came to a conclusion; they purposely igonored 2\/3 of all the orders that were placed. We could have understood if one or two or even a few orders were missing, there were like 20 other items that we waited for nothing. \n\nOverall, I was just so embrassed because I took our coworkers to this place and we all had a bad expereince. \n\nFood (2.5\/5) Service (0.5\/5) PERIOD!!\nI am not ever coming back to this freakin place.\nPlease be aware if you go in large groups they WILL ignore your orders.","date":"2016-08-26 05:28:45"}

I'm still amazed at how fresh their fish was. I'm very sensitive to raw fish because I can detect even the slightest fowl taste in raw fish. But, all the nigiri we had ordered were so fresh that they all melted in your mouth! I loved the cajun tuna the most as it added a little bit more flavor to the tuna. We also got the popcorn lobster roll, which is also another item i've never seen elsewhere before. Their rolls were made of fresh ingredients as well and the popcorn lobster added the perfect crisp to the roll.  I think their prices are very reasonable, but their portions are a little smaller than normal. However, their AYCE price is $25, which makes it all well worth it! They were also very generous on Thanksgiving, they had given us a free plate of sashimi (not sure what type of fish it was) for our table of 9, and that was really fresh as well. All in all, I'm super happy to have found this place as their service was good and patient with our large party.","date":"2014-12-02 19:15:23"}

If there is a last call at 11:30 honor it- I expect a smile and service until 11:29. Servers that don't want people to walk 30-20 minutes before closing ruin diners experiences because they are tired but it is called SERViCE so suck it up or change jobs. I tip well and that server lost  $20 on serving 2 people and my friend refuses to go here again. \n\nYou may also notice someone else complimented this post because they had the same experience.\n\nUpdated review: Taking all my stars away. We showed up at 111:20 and they didn't want to serve us. They said oh last call is at 11:30. We said ok- we had 10 Minutes and we'd been there before. We were open to ordering 1 big order of sushi fast and they said ok though they didn't want to. We sat down knowing we would be rushed but open but no one came over with an order pad... I mean we just left because it felt like they didn't want our business since it was late. \n\nThey were still serving two large parties that we're going to be visiting and stuff..\n\nUsually we come here annually for my friends bday but she never wants to come back now.","date":"2015-12-23 07:28:35"}

I had not been there in over a year and decided to go with my mom for my birthday.  When we entered, there was no line and plenty of seating. The bar was empty, all empty half-booths to the left, 1 empty booth to the right. My mom had asked for a booth of any side (she's in the late 50's and has back problems), but it was not allowed since we were only a party of two, and they said they were anticipating party of 4's or 6's. There weren't any reservation signs except for the big table in the middle. My mom insisted, but I didn't want to push it because I didn't want to take a chance for bad service.\n\nWhen we were ordering, my mom had questions about some items. Our server did not know some of the sushi items and admitted he doesn't know much because he doesn't even eat sushi. Really?\n\nAnyway, the meal was good, but not great.The salmon sushi did not taste buttery and delicious like the last times I went. I also was really bummed out that they ran out of plum ice cream. That's my favorite and the main reason I wanted to go to Sakana. I was going to order 5 scoops, too. I settled for honey toast. It was okay.\n\nWhile I was eating, I noticed a young couple being seated at one of the half-booths on the left. They (the servers) had split a 4-top table for them even though there was an empty 2-top table right behind me. It kinda annoyed me. I only told my mom about it when she was paying, and she was pissed off. We talked to a supervisor about it, and repeated that they were anticipating party of 4 to 6. I didn't get it because the booths were now with groups of 4, but one couple on one of them and an extra empty half-booth for 2. There were more tables for 2, so they were trying to make bad excuses. I didn't want to make a big deal, but I was annoyed because it was my birthday and my mom was really upset and felt discriminated against (the couple was white, we're filipino.) So I rushed my mom out of there, and I'll never look back.","date":"2017-06-18 08:08:58"}

The affordable, well-reviewed Sakana easily won out. \n\nIf you show up at Sakana between the hours of 12-3 pm, you can order AYCE sushi at the \"lunch\" price, which is $20.95 (versus the $24.95 dinner price). We showed up just under the wire at around 2:45, so snagged the cheaper pricing. \n\nWe absolutely gorged on AYCE sushi. I ordered a ton of nigiri (salmon belly, yuzu yellowtail and sea trout were highlights), and a single, massive lobster roll that I could barely finish. Friends ordered mostly rolls and a few nigiri. I capped off my meal with a small bowl of mango mochi ice cream, and one companion enjoyed her mini honey toast topped with ice cream. \n\nConsidering the sushi was AYCE, our expectations were suitably low, and mostly, the sushi tasted fresh enough and satisfying. The variety on the menu was sure impressive. \n\nMy only complaints: Most nigiri came drenched in some type of vinegar or citrus juice, resulting in soggy rice that usually fell apart as my chopsticks grabbed it. (Were these dressings used to mask the flavor of less-than-fresh fish? I hope not). And the rolls were mostly smothered in mayonnaise-y sauces and tempura-fried, rather than arriving simple, light and unadorned. (Not my taste, but others might love them). \n\nIn retrospect, I did wonder whether AYCE is the best option at Sakana, considering how affordable the a la carte menu is. Rolls that would be $15.95 in LA cost only $7.95 (or less) here. Nigiri is, on average, only $2.95.  If you are super ravenous, you'd probably spend more than $20.95 a la carte.... but if you're only moderately hungry, stick with a (huge) roll and a couple nigiri off the a la carte menu, and you'll save a few bucks from the AYCE price.  \n\nStill, this is a great deal if you're hungry enough for AYCE, especially if you come during lunchtime. Looking forward to my next visit!","date":"2015-05-28 21:37:23"}

Price is reasonable for the amount of food you get!! Never disappoints!!\n\n\nFirst time coming here as I read reviews on yelp so my mom and I decided to try this place. . I've been to other places here before it was our first time coming to Sakana for AYCE sushi! The price isn't too bad at about $25.95 per person. We came here on a Friday night and waited about 3 mins. and we sat at the sushi bar. Place is a bit small but very different and unique.\n\nGood thing about this place is that not only was the sushi good, but also their service. Fast service and great service with help all the time from picking up your empty plates to refilling your drink. The food came quick. Out of all the sashimi and suhi\/sushi rolls we ordered, the only thing that wasn't cooked right was the shrimp's head as they weren't really fresh. Besides that, I can't really complain much about this place. I would highly recommended this place and we will come back here for a AYCE sushi. THE BEST SUSHI IN VEGAS SO FRESH.\n\n\nSo glad I found one amazing sushi place here that's fresh and delicious. Thank you SAKANA","date":"2017-08-18 13:12:01"}

WHA?!)\n\nYesterday we had:\n\nGarlic Tuna\nSuper White\nCajun Albacore\nUnagi\nEbi\nSmoked Paprikia Salmon\nOcean Trout\nScallop\nThe X Man Hand roll\nTako (Octopus)\nA Lobster Nigiri roll (can't remember the name right now)\nA lobster and bacon skewer\nSeafood salad\nSpicy garlic edemame\nGyoza\nEgg Rolls\nSeaweed Salad\nMini Honey Toast\n\nSo, the really good:\nThe Garlic Tuna. \nFor me, this is just under the quality of Sumo Sushi's garlic tuna, which is the best I've ever had.  \nSakana's was AWESOME.  Super garlicky, moist, and HUGE.\n\nYeah, let me take a moment to discuss the portion sizes.\nRidiculous.  SO. MUCH. FISH.\nOn the one hand, I was thrilled about this.  The fish to rice ratio is amazing here.  Small amount of rice, TONS of fish.  \nOn the other hand...I was able to eat a lot less because the fish portion was basically doubled, so I hit my wall a lot faster than normal. \n\nAlso really good:  \nThe Lobster nigiri roll:  lobster and crab with a bit of cream cheese (I think) was lovely.  Even my fella liked it, and he's not a fan of cream cheese. \n\nThe Smoked Paprika Salmon: I'm not usually a fan of salmon sushi, but this had great flavor. \n\nThe Scallop:  I was really stuffed by the time I ate this, but I'm so glad I did.  Delicious tender scallops on rice wrapped in seaweed, topped with a tiny slice of lemon:  mmm. \n\nThe X Man hand roll: \nSoy paper, rice, beef and salsa, this was like a teriyaki burrito.  Fella didn't care for it, but I'd order it next time for sure.  Really tasty.\n\nThe Seafood salad:  Holy sashimi Batman!  TONS of fish, dicon radish, cucumbers, jalapenos...mmm.  and HUGE.    \n\nThe Mini Honey Toast:  I got excited when I saw this dessert.  A favorite of mine, Honey Toast isn't something I am able to have very often...this was incredible.  We ordered mine, and my fella doesn't usually do dessert...but after one bite of mine, he ordered his own!\n\nNow the good, but slightly different\/strange:\nThe Super White:  Fish was great, but they put screaming o sauce on it...for me, it took away a bit of the flavor of the fish, and my fella hated it.  \n\nThe Ebi:  Delicious, but the small lemon slices on top added just a bit too much to the shrimp.  It brightened the flavor, but was a touch too much. \n\nThe Unagi:  DELICIOUS...but I don't know if they just have a different eel sauce, but this was more of a ponzu sauce.  So it was good, but not what I was expecting. \n\nThe Ocean Trout:  Good fish, good flavor, but the toppings were just a little...salsa like for me.\n\nThe Cajun Albacore was a little weird, with a crunchy topping that I've never seen before. \n\nThe good\/Standard:\nSeaweed Salad\nGyoza\nEggrolls\nLobster and bacon skewer\nSpicy Garlic Edemame.  \n\nAll good, nothing spectacular or amazing.\n\nThe service here was on point.  Fast.  Friendly.  Everything you could ask for in a sushi restaurant, really.\n\nI will absolutely eat here again.  There are lots of things on the menu that I want to try that I didn't have room for yesterday. \n\nDInner is only $24.95, and apparently they have 2 for 1 sake and beer every day...I may try that out next time, since I didn't have a chance to yesterday.\n\nAll in all, a very good spot for endless sushi!","date":"2015-05-01 20:43:04"}

If I could only choose one of these two I'd definitely pick Sakana. \n\nI liked the place as soon as I walked in. It looks like a cute little restaurant decked out in Japanese stuff. It was a cute environment and fun to look at everything they had going on.\n\nIt's about $20 for lunch until 3:00p and then it goes up like $3 for dinner. It's a great price as most AYCE places are about $27 for dinner. Sakana also has all of the premium items you pay the extra couple of bucks for like uni, oysters, ect. It's definitely worth the price in my opinion.\n\nI came for lunch with a couple of friends and their kitchen is FAST. I would place orders on things and get them within minutes. They have a really sweet team. I was nervous reading reviews but I got lucky. I ordered the pictured hand roll and it came to me in like under a minute. The appetizers from the kitchen came out hot and fast also. Empty plates were cleared quickly. Orders could be given to anyone and they did ask often. It went swimmingly. No complaints at all.\n\nTheir appetizer selection is big enough, but not huge. The items they do have are done well. I tried the age dashi tofu and the pork belly. \n\nThe main item IMO aside from the fresh fish would have to be tempura shrimp. Why? That's my favorite item in a sushi roll. I really like their shrimp tempura so although I don't remember which rolls I got I did think they were all good. The fried items came out hot in the rolls while the cold items were cold. That's the most enjoyable types of rolls to me.\n\nMy one \"complaint\" is their rolls menu is so huge! Not a real complaint lol It's very intimidating or hard to figure out what to order. I suggest looking at Yelp photos or just reading. We did get recommendations from the server which made this a none issue.\n\nTheir nigiri that was served was also really good. They serve large slices of fish on their rice. This was a highlight for me. I was able to try different fish without getting full off of a huge rice to fish ratio.\n\nThe restaurant was clean, service was attentive, their food quality was good, and I can't wait to go back. Add the affordable price and Sakana now is up there on my AYCE  sushi list.\n\nPro tip! I heard a group next to us pay the dinner price to get their dinner specials. I wish I knew this was an option earlier on as I did want to try their oysters and uni along with their other dinner only items.","date":"2015-10-27 01:37:44"}

Average based on the breakdown at the bottom of this review.\n\nThe AYCE here (for dinner) is extremely #worth if you can break even by eating at minimum 2 premium rolls (for example, $9.95 each for the sashimi or rainbow), and at least two orders of the premium 2pc sushi (for example, $4.95 for each of the oyster \/ salmon belly \/ uni). Everything else ordered past that (per person) is worth it since you already broke even (based on the a la carte prices on the menu, which are incredibly pricey for the portion sizes).\n\nI was a party of 1 and there was an end seat at the sushi bar, which I gladly took. This made ordering extremely easy - I was in and out within 30 minutes of arriving, even after waiting 5 minutes after putting my name in the queue (4 parties ahead of me, all of size 2 or greater). \n\nAfter tax, the AYCE dinner came out to $28.03 (pre-tip). My experience was great, since the sushi chef was extremely attentive and helpful at describing what was good, although this may have been due to me sitting directly in front of him at the sushi bar.\n\n1) VARIETY\/SELECTION: 7\/10. Had a decent selection & offering, but this is Las Vegas, which is in a landlocked state, and no access to fresh fish - you get what your geography gives you.\n\n2) FRESHNESS: 8\/10. Again, it's land-locked, don't go in expecting Kashiba-level freshness. This isn't near a farmer's market, nor is it going to taste as fresh as one.\n\n3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10\/10. If I ordered the equivalent meal off of the a-la-carte menu (which is the same as the AYCE menu, but you pay the listed price instead of the AYCE price), I would have had to pay closer to $78, given that each of the premium rolls are $9.95 (I ordered 4), the 2pc sushi dishes were $4.95 each (I ordered 6), and other dishes ranged from $2.95 (cheaper sushi pieces) to $14.50 (Seafood Salad).\n\n4) SERVICE: 9.5\/10. This is somewhat biased since I was sitting at the sushi bar, and the sushi chef I could order from was literally serving only me and a few table orders (despite the place being packed to the point of a wait list). The wait staff weren't super attentive, and the -0.5 stars is from my water being not refilled for over 20 minutes (even though the wait staff camped behind me since that's where the point-of-sale device was).\n\n5) PRICE: 10\/10. I didn't eat lunch and wanted something filling, given that I had hiked this entire day. Needless to say, $33 including tip for an all-you-can-eat sushi meal is a bargain.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor is somewhat nice too; the TV was playing K-Pop songs the entire time I was there (I saw \"Gentleman\" and \"Hangover\" by PSY, as well as some K-Pop male idol group whose name escapes me). Interesting that a Japanese restaurant plays so much K-Pop.\n\nI'll visit again next time I'm in town - great recommendation if you're craving AYCE sushi in Las Vegas!","date":"2017-06-07 16:50:38"}

At 4:00 it was already packed, a good sign. We were lucky enough to get the last big table. First off, anyone that offers ALL DAY 2 for 1 beer wine and sake is on my favorites list, but that's just the beginning. The AYCE here includes lots of appetizers, salads and soup. \n\nAndy started out as our server and explained the menu, drinks and answered many questions. Since there were 5 of us we were able to sample many of the appetizers, sushi and rolls. We started off with \"the shit\", dragon balls, pork belly, miso soup and chicken fried rice. Everything was delicious, still not sure what was in the shit but it was really good! \n\nThen the feast began. Several orders of the towering poke (Loved these!), yellow tail, spicy tuna, dancing eel, something wrong roll, snow in Vegas, and on and on and on. Kevin took over as our server and made sure we were taken care of just as Andy did. I couldn't believe how much we ate, finally ending with the honey toast with ice cream. All of the sushi was generously cut and super fresh. The rolls were all excellent with the dancing eel and something wrong (the garlic ponzu was amazing) being my favorites. There was never a long wait the food just kept coming and coming despite how busy it was. \n\nthe AYCE dinner is now up to $25.95 and desserts are now limited to one each. Still our bill for 5 AYCE and 4 beers only came to $150. We easily ate twice that amount or more. Sakana is definitely worthy of its 5 star reviews and I WILL be back for more!","date":"2016-02-01 20:49:26"}

Came here on one of my vegas trips, we decided to stop by before checking in our hotel. The menu was very scattered and it was hard to interpret some areas but I think it's because they have so many options. I would say 4x more options then your neighborhood AYCE restaurant. Some of my favorite appetizers were the fried pork belly and bulgogi nachos. I had the orange blossom roll which is a great starting roll and then I followed it up with the golden tiger roll which I have to say is one of the best roll I've ever had. My friends ordered a bunch of nigiri and they all taste fresh and authentic. The texture and portion of the fish they put on top is larger than most which I think is awesome. The nigiri that stood out the most was the salmon nigiri, definitely recommend! What sets these guys apart from the rest is they have a dessert section for their AYCE, which is unheard of. I got the mini honey toast topped with ice cream. Dessert sections for AYCE are dangerous! lol. Besides the menu being all over the place I noticed the restaurant was obviously short staffed with the waitresses looking like they are running around with their heads chopped off. You feel really bad for them and can't even get mad because it is AYCE and everyone is ordering every minute.

We wanted to pay more for the dinner so we could order the salmon belly (no because they don't prepare it early) we had two pieces of sushi left and the busser was hesitant to take it because he wanted to check with the AYCE.

I didn't have any expectations of this place, except that I hoped for $25 it would be decent. They completely surpassed my expectations. Sushi is one of my favorite things to eat, but living the midwest I am limited in the places that have good quality fish, I am usually paying $25 for 2 great rolls at a legit place. So to pay $25 for all you can eat (affectionately dubbed ACYE), I was pretty much in Heaven.\n\nWe mainly stuck with Nigiri, and only did a few rolls and apps. I think we ate 15 orders of 2pc Nigiri each!!! The selection of fish is outstanding, and they will even let you order some of the more expensive cuts (toro etc) at least 2 times per person. I consider that pretty generous. Their \"signature\" sauce here was a garlic ponzu, and while it was mighty tasty on the first few orders, it got old really fast. You can ask for the fish and the rice plain for any of the nigiri, which we started doing after a couple of orders. The fish are a nice cut, and thick too. They aren't skimping on you here. They also have hand roll, maki, and baked rolls but we wanted to keep it simple that day.\n\nDefinitely recommended as an excursion off the strip if you love sushi and basic Japanese apps (agadashi tofu, kaarage etc). Also it was conveniently located next to a Target if you need to load up on anything while on your trip. We bought a case of water for the hotel room and it was a total hangover and hydrating money saver.","date":"2015-06-11 15:41:21"}

The dinner menu has a few things offered that are not included in the lunch price including sashmi rolls, ama ebi, and uni. Otherwise, the rest of the menu is fair game for lunch and dinner. Some of my staple items for Sakana include the garlic tuna and salmon nigiri as well as the Hawaiian and Be Happy rolls. \n\nThe service is really quick and efficient here which I love. Once you order your sushi, a blink and it's already in front of you! It's probably more for their sake of turning over customers because the wait and line can be quite extensive but it's still nice to have quick service.\n\nMy favorite thing about this place is their fish-to-rice ratio (yes, that's a real thing in case you didn't know). It's a huge slice of decent quality fish with rice. It's one of the best ratios out there, trust. \n\nThere are a few dessert menus if you can manage to keep a pocket of stomach for it after your sushi. Only one order allowed per customer though :( they also advertise a 2 for 1 special on beers, wines and house sake all day every day!\n\nOverall, one of my favorite if not the best AYCE sushi place that I've been to here in Vegas and I wouldn't hesitate coming again or recommending it to friends\/visitors.","date":"2017-01-06 04:31:16"}

Like lightning fast. But I rather get struck by lightning than eat this lightning fast food. I was gagging due to the terrible taste of each roll. It tasted rotten and terrible. The spicy rolls tasted salty, sour and bitter at the same time. I did not even expect that to be possible. It did not taste spicy. It took all my strength to continue chewing. It took half a cup of water to down each roll. It got harder and harder as we went along. At first, I was wondering how I can get rid of the rolls without paying or eating them. But it got to the point where my boyfriend and I just had enough. I was willing to pay EXTRA to not have to finish the rolls.

I would say pregame here before your clubbing night on the strip! haha! \n\nSashimi pieces were thick and the rice portion was just right. Rolls were amazing as well. Appetizer options were overwhelming! I was super happy and satisfied. I will definitely come back and definitely recommend others to come here.","date":"2017-11-20 23:42:14"}

Sakana offers the silkiest super white, yuzu yellowtail, spicy tuna, and salmon. The nigiri melts in your mouth and explodes with the freshest flavors. Whether it's ponzu sauce, cajun flavors, or the natural flavor of the fish, you can find them all at Sakana.  \nAs far as waiting\/service, all evening was minimum waiting time.

I would try to come here with a good appetite so you can get your money's worth. \n\n    How the ayce works is you just order off the menu and they take your orders, instead of a buffet where you grab a plate and fill it with sushi. I think this is better than buffet style, since what you are getting hasn't been sitting out and is very fresh. \n\n   Most of the items we tried was good. I really enjoyed the assorted nigiri such as the yellowtail and trout. The fish to rice ratio is actually quite good and they put big pieces on top of small piles of rice. \n\n    We actually tried to avoid eating too many rolls (since we thought it would fill us up too fast bc of the rice) but the chef's no. 1 roll was really tasty. I also thought their seafood salad and sashimi rolls were excellent (unfortunately it's a one time order for ayce)\n\n    The downside I found is that I would avoid anything with lobster. They tend to mix the lobster with a lot of imitation crab and mayo so you don't really taste the lobster. Actually, all their crab items are really just imitation crab mixed with lots of mayo. \n\n    Some other items I wouldn't bother with was the bulgogi nachos. (Way too much mayo on the nachos) The desserts weren't bad but I felt the tempura ice cream was way too much fried batter with just whipped cream on top.\n\n     Also, if you think you can get away with not eating the rice stuck to the nigiri, think again. They have an extra charge for rice that goes uneaten. \n\n    Overall, it was a decent place to pig out off the strip in Las Vegas. Definitely a solid ayce sushi restaurant.","date":"2015-08-10 05:48:50"}

We decided to get the AYCE sushi for the dinner price of $22.95 (lunch is $20.95).  The waitress asked us if we wanted to add the All You Can Drink for an extra $3 (!).  We had to opt out, but its ok, next time!  Anyways we mainly ate nigiri, like Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna, etc.  They were all succulent and quite fresh!  I liked how there were sauces for some of the nigiri because they each complimented their fish.\n\nWe tried to order Uni (Sea Urchin), but a sushi chef (head chef maybe?) came up to us in person to apologize that he couldn't get it shipped in this week because his supplier had told him the Uni weren't fresh due to weather conditions.

Had only 6 orders and we had to cancel our last one because we were there for almost 2 hours! I had to storm up to them in order to ask for my check because they would not get it to me fast enough. Kept ignoring me when I tried to flag them down. Never ever coming here again! Would never recommend this place. Ridiculous how we came in first and our order took forever, yet another group came after us and got their all their food before us even though they had ordered more than us. Would never recommend this place to anyone.","date":"2016-06-16 04:02:32"}

Our skepticism was soon swept away as we were warmly received by a friendly waiter, Kevin.  He walked us through the menu and helped us in placing an initial order.

Seeing that Sakana was a popular choice with 4 stars, I placed my bet here hoping that it would be yummy. Dinner was $26 and since we came before 5:30PM we didn't have to wait in line. The restaurant was very cute looking with the decor but a little small.\n\nThe menu is extensive, like super big with so many choices from hand rolls to yakitori to hot rolls to nigiri to appetizer. I ordered all nigiri and was not disappointed in the fish quality and size! My favorites were the salmon belly, yellowtail, and squid. The Amai ebi (sweet shrimp) was great as well!!! The uni was bitter though and I wasn't a real fan. The only appetizer I got was the pork belly which was fatty and delicious!! \n\nThey offered many dessert options but they weren't super amazing. Ice cream was melted and the tempura ice cream was disappointing as the tempura surrounding the ice cream part was white bread deep fried. Tiramisu was a no-no but the housemade green tea panna Cotta was great though small. \n\nThe only big problem I had was that when I first ordered, they forgot to give me about half my orders. And so, I had to reorder that part all over again, which was pretty annoying. The servers were kind though and helpful and water was always refilled without asking.  \n\nIf you're around the strip, this isn't too far off and is a great ayce option if you don't want to eat at a buffet!","date":"2017-05-28 23:47:01"}

Salmon was a bit slimy, octopus was rubbery and tasted like it had freezer burn and some other things were just really \"fishy.\"  The good part about the nigri was that there was hardly any rice. The yellowtail and squid were decent but other than that I wasn't too impressed. \n\nThe rolls were good but I think the sauce covered up a lot of the extra fishy taste and smell. I ended up ordering things from the kitchen like the soft shell crab (really good actually) and calamari tempura to fill up my stomach. \n\nWe were the only ones there for lunch which was a bit weird for a Saturday.

If I had opted for the AYCE, the rating would perhaps be higher since quantity often trumps quality in that case. But in ordering regular rolls at list price, Sakana was just not worth it. \n\nThe interior is pretty typical of a Japanese restaurant, although I did notice that the freestanding tables towards the middle were interestingly arranged in diamond formation rather than square. Service was fine and tea refills were plentiful, although my waiter failed to inquire whether my table was ordering off the menu or doing AYCE. He just assumed we were doing the AYCE option even though we only ordered three rolls. \n\nBam Bam roll:\nThe fish was mushy on top, the fish was even mushier inside, and the ingredients were unevenly distributed throughout the roll. I appreciated that this roll wasn't made with a plethora of rice just as filler, but the paper-thin pieces of fish were almost tasteless. \n\nLemon salmon roll:\nAgain nice ratio of other ingredients to rice, but the imitation crab inside was so saturated with mayonnaise that I had a hard time tasting anything else. The salmon slices on top were a little more generous on this roll, but the lemon wedges were unevenly cut and placed. That may be fine for AYCE, but paying $10+ for that lack of attention to detail was disappointing. The roll was also served as pictured -- with one piece lying flat. This is because that piece was so large and irregularly sliced that it couldn't stand up, and the other pieces were variably cut into larger and smaller pieces as well.\n\nPopcorn lobster roll:\nThis was the worst of the meal, and that's actually saying something. The \"lobster\" balls on top were of some minced seafood variety, but I honestly couldn't taste any seafood flavor. They were also overly breaded and bordered on being over-fried, and the goopy sauce on top did nothing to alleviate their lack of flavor. The sushi pieces on the bottom were again sloppily made and cut into all different sizes, which made the whole dish even more unappetizing. I wouldn't recommend this, even as an AYCE option.\n\nI'm so confused by the high ratings here. Perhaps I came on an off day or perhaps the endless nigiris ordered during AYCE could offset subpar sushi skills and unappetizing ingredients.. but I probably won't be back to find out.","date":"2017-02-12 05:50:56"}

Being from NYC I have eaten a lot of sushi, and this place definitely deserves a recommendation for awesome sushi. Firstly, the fish was very fresh, and everything was made to order. Once inside, we were informed that if you were to do their AYCE option, everyone at the table must comply. Not a problem, because everything on their menu, from appetizers to desserts are included. Warning, they make you pay for leftovers, which includes eating the fish off the rice and leaving the rice behind (so come hungry!!!). They have an amazing variety of specialty rolls, and lots of delicious creations across the board. Their list of nigiri was lengthy, and the staff was exceedingly friendly in both service and explanation of different menu items.

I believe that sushi is an art and its incredibly hard to find a place with the perfect balance of fish rice and toppings. I feel like this place had good fish. That's a big deal because most places in town don't. they were a little heavy on the rice which is kind of typical. a lot of places give way too much rice to make you full faster and then charge you if you leave any rice behind. Albacore is my go to on any menu. I already know that if the albacore isn't up to par the place wasn't very good. fortunately the fish its self was delicious but they put an over whelming amount of toppings on it. i could barely taste the fish. I still haven't found a place that is as good as Sushi Koma in town.

Many choices as AYCE should be. Not too much rice. I would recommend telling them light on some of the sauces because while enjoyable at first out second and third rounds felt too sweet the last time we went... But that was our palate and can happen at any sushi place...\n\nThere is an lovely older woman who is usually there, I am assuming the owner who keeps things very organized.

Get the No Name roll too, it's by far the favorite although the What the Hell is a close second. Affogato and Honey Toast for dessert is by far the best. Enjoy Yelp!","date":"2016-12-08 04:03:48"}

Based on the yelp reviews, it sounded like a good place, but this is one of those times that yelp had done me wrong :(  Came here about a month ago for dinner with a few friends on a Friday night.  Probably will not be back.  Service wasn't bad, but the quality of the sushi and fish just isn't worth it.\n\nIt's located on the corner of Flamingo and Maryland, in the Target complex.  It was a little difficult to find, because there was no actual sign that read Sakana.  From what I remember, I think the restaurant used to be called \"Kabuki.\"  I think that sign was still up.  \n\nAnyway, there was 6 of us.  When we walked in, there were a bunch of empty tables that had yet to be cleaned up--maybe low on staff?  There's a sushi bar and a few TVs that played some Asian pop music videos.  Quite entertaining to watch lol!\n\nWe were seated shortly after one of the employees had a chance to clear up one of the tables.  She promptly brought us our beer and water as we requested (I remember them having beer specials--I think a 2 for 1 deal), but it felt like it took forever to order and get our food.  We ordered a variety of things from the menu--rolls, appetizers, nigiri.  The food was less than mediocre.  One of the things we had ordered (I can't quite remember, I think it was the albacore) was fishy--to the point where I had to spit it up into my napkin.  Mind you, I love sushi. I know my sushi. And I take pride in the fact that I know the difference in quality.  The appetizers weren't bad.  I liked the chicken and the mussels.  Other than that, I felt pretty let down.  And I felt like I let my friends down for suggesting the place :(... Oh well, ya win some, ya lose some. Probably won't be back again.","date":"2013-11-21 01:54:30"}

Friendship goals, y'all. \n\nSo, I came here with my darling sushi skank on a Wednesday evening around 7 and it was PACKED! First of all, the parking lot was packed and I was like \"no big deal. People are probably off to do other things besides eat all the sushi I want\". Nope, Sakana was packed, with a wait list. What in the shizz is this actually about? It's WEDNESDAY! Okay, okay. So, we got on the wait list and sat on this little bench near the front door and stalked people who were eating, all while proclaiming how excited and hungry we were. We waited probably 15 minutes and that was quite enough of that nonsense.\n\nThen....we were seated! Yay. Everyone from the front staff to the waiters and water peeps were all very friendly and seemed to generally want to assist in creating a good experience. Thank you! There is nothing worse than getting crappy service but good food. Winning all around! So, anyway, the food. Pretty amazing. In my sushi blackout, I actually managed to make a little note on my phone of what I ate(pat on the back, dude).\n\nHere is(most)of what I ate before I rolled out of this joint, gastro sick and questioning my life choices:\n*Spicy garlic edamame(the bomb.com. For reals, yo. This is my jam right here. Salty, spicy, garlicky, hot, intense, amazing. Get it and thank me later). *Agedashi tofu(not the best I`ve ever had but certainly a contender for my heart. I love me some agedashi tofu. I wanted more. I wish the portion was larger). *Green baked mussels(Maybe it's just me, but I didn`t particular enjoy these here. I guess this is a Vegas thing? I`m not sure. I had them at one place I enjoyed them at and the rest have just been OK. Pass for me). * Nigiri was enjoyed in the form of tuna, yellowtail, cajun tuna, octopus, seared lemon salmon. All were good but my stand outs were the cajun tuna, octopus and seared lemon salmon. I could live off of those. *Hand rolls(not jobs, rolls): Lemon salmon(I admittedly love lemon and salmon so this was really an amazing experience for me), Lisa Lisa(Meh. Not my thing. Too much sauce, too much...too much), Golden Tiger(another one I didn`t pick and didn`t particularly care for because I felt like my arteries were clogging the moment I ate this deep fried monster), Bam bam roll(really yummy. I would get it again).\n\nRandom choice: Towering Sashimi Poki. It was good but I`m not sure I would order it again because it did feel a bit \"heavy\" for me with the crispy wonton underneath the sauced up fish. It was alright. Worth a try if you're into sauce and spice.\n\nAt the end I had green tea panna cotta, which was surprisingly addicted and I wanted to ask for another and another. \n\nOverall, I want to come back here, so if you're in the mood for sushi, please take me out!","date":"2016-03-21 22:11:31"}

It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said \"yes\" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.\n\nNext thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all \"eff it, we're starving, let's eat\".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  \n\nWe chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:\n\nChef: Did you just get married?\nUs: No.  It's been over 6 years.\nChef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.\n\n(a few minutes later)\n\nChef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?\nWife: No it's not.\nChef: Well why else would he take you here?\n\nHAHA\n\n(later)\n\nChef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.\nMe: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!\n\nSo on to the food.  They had an appetizer called \"The Shit\".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  \n\nTheir pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?\n\nI liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.

Needless to say I was on the hunt for a new sushi place! A friend of mine (who's a frequent yelper) suggested we try this place. Right off the bat I noticed how clean the restaurant was and the decor was cute. I hadn't seen my friend in a long time so we were catching up for about a good 20 minutes before we actually got to order. The server came over a couple times and we weren't ready (*cringe* we were those people!) but our server was okay with us taking our time. Thumbs up for that.\nNow the food! We got the seafood salad, the Chanel roll, the popcorn lobster roll, Lisa Lisa, and the Hawaiian roll. We finished off with mango mochi, coffee mochi, and green tea ice cream. Everything was absolutely delicious and the fish was really fresh. I love the fact that even though we got AYCE there was still an abundance of protein. In my experience most AYCE places pile on the rice and skimp on the fish. \nIn the middle of dinner, the music went up and the lights went off! I love the fact that everyone was excited about this customers birthday and I noticed that the group celebrating the birthday had brought a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes. So if I or someone I know decides to have a birthday dinner here it's nice to know we can bring our own cake in. Most places won't allow you to do that. \nOverall I was satisfied and I will definitely return!","date":"2015-09-15 11:16:11"}

If I thought lunch here was already outstanding, dinner kicked it up a couple of notches higher!  Aside from more menu items being available during dinner, the mood and ambiance of this restaurant is way nicer.  The place was nearly full of people, the sushi chefs were having fun, and there's just this atmosphere perfect for unwinding after a long work week.\n\nBeing my second time here, I can say that the food quality and presentation has improved.  I don't know if food is just deliberately more elaborately prepared during dinner service or if it was a planned improvement altogether.  We sampled most of the dinner-only items and the stand outs to me are the sashimi salad, screaming-o, sashimi roll, and the towering poke.  Heck, everything we ordered was fantastic!\n\nOne thing I should mention is that while service did seem to lag a bit during Sakana's peak occupancy while we were there, I can tell that it's definitely not due to lack of effort or enthusiasm of the kitchen and wait staff.  Our servers had a great attitude even when things were frantic.  Overall, our food was delivered just as fast as we can eat them and our glasses not empty for very long.  Sakana is definitely legit and is a must try for ayce sushi addicts.","date":"2013-10-12 05:03:50"}

I ordered a Spider Roll which was very good. I like this Nigeri menu since it only comes in two rolls instead of eight or six. I was able to finish my rolls and eat a lot at the same time. I also ordered the Dynamite it was okay but my friend thought I was salty. My friend enjoyed the rolls that he ordered. The dessert were kind of disappointing for us. My friend ordered the black manager he tasted it was a weird taste at first but it got better. I ordered the mini toast with honey and the toast I felt like taste a Hawaiian rolll that you get at a store but drizzled with honey and ice cream at the top but overall it still good. I would come back here again for the price 25.95 for All You Can Eat Sushi most other sushi place i been too there usually 26 or 27 depends on where you go.","date":"2018-04-07 14:17:50"}

Sakana used to be Kabuki, but quite honestly the change to Sakana was a good change.\n\nThe first thing was that the sushi chefs were really attentive and made lots of small talk. My plate and cup weren't empty for long after I had finished my food or drink.\n\nI tried about every type of nigiri they had besides 2-3 of the items that I tend not to try in any sushi place and I must say every piece was fresh. The sauces that came along with the nigiri complimented each piece of fish very nicely. I also liked the fact that the tako was cut thinner than in most other places. I prefer not to spend 5 minutes trying to break down a piece of octopus.\n\nThe rolls in the menu were also quite varied and I managed to try the baked lobster roll and a tempura\/eel roll. Both rolls were quite good and I would have tried a few more, but by that time I was getting full on nigiri. \n\nOverall though Sakana was really good and I encourage people to give it a shot. I've tried quite a few places and I can say that Sakana is up there in terms of Vegas AYCE. Hopefully they can keep it up because if they do there will be another solid ayce spot in town.","date":"2013-07-22 21:47:07"}

But it is AYCE.  AYCE sushi places are few in Southern California.  This place is Korean owned.  I am part Korean and Japanese and I can tell when people speak either or.  I don't care if sushi places are Korean owned as long as it tastes fresh and their sushi rice is good. Upon entrance the owner with the short hair was curt but she seemed efficient in getting people seated. You have to sign your name and the number of people in your party on the clipboard and wait until your name is called. \n\nOnce seated, it took too long to get menus. Our server was female and although she was quick at getting our order, there was a hidden annoyance I could detect throughout our entire meal. I never felt comfortable ordering through her.  She wasn't friendly.  Everyone else helping her out with our table was friendly though.  I did like how quickly everything was delivered and dirty dishes picked up from our table quickly. \n\nI did not like their ama ebi (sweet shrimp). It had the most disgusting, slimy texture and the fried heads tasted off.  I usually love the stuff but I couldn't finish the fried heads here.  They limit your order to one piece.  Thank goodness I didn't get sick from it.  \n\nI really loved their seafood salad, super white fish sushi and garlic tuna sushi.  This place also includes dessert into their fixed all you can eat price.  Not a bad option for $26 if you're in the area and really hungry.  It's a good sign when place is busy, high turnover with the fish.  You want that when you're eating raw fish.","date":"2016-03-24 01:05:10"}

That was a good decision.  \n\nCame here for AYCE.  They have a good list of items, and one of the best things about this place is they offer half orders (for most sushi rolls).\n\nI noticed alot of their items are similar to the items that are in Sumo Sushi or Jjanga.  They also have some korean food, and I'm curious if they are affiliated with Hwaro....only because the first time I tried \"the Shit\" was in Hwaro, and they offer than same \"the Shit\" here in Sakana.  \n\nThey have every time of fish, including my favorites that cannot be found in all places: super white tuna, salmon belly, and yellowtail belly.  They are very generous with their portions to.  I like that they put some kind of sauce in their nigiris so it doesn't taste too plain.  \n\nThey rolls were good.  I got the Something Wrong roll, which has the fried soft shell crab on the inside, and two pieces of fish on the outside with garlic ponzu sauce.  One of my favorites.  Also tried some of their spicy rolls, and yes they were spicy!  \n\nAlso on of my favorites about this place is the desserts.  Most AYCE only offer one thing of dessert, but you can order some of the dessert items more than once (except ice cream).  \n\nBeing in an older location (and maybe it was wrong for me to judge a restroom based on this), the restroom is very clean.  There's a floor lamp and Hello Kitty painted on the back of the women's restrooms.  \n\nThis has definitely become one of my favorite sushi places.","date":"2016-04-27 02:33:04"}

Reviews are fairly accurate in that the food is pretty good.  We managed to snag a seat at the sushi bar and lucked out with a very nice waiter.  He explained everything very well and made a few good suggestions.  We opted for the dinner ayce .The wife and I were generally satisfied with our waiter and the food.  We did notice a few things to keep a lookout for.  Every time we ordered two of the special orders that only comes with dinner prices, which we did, they only made one, and we had to flag down our waiter to reorder it again.  It happened enough to know it was deliberate.  We also noticed our uni order was shorted by cutting all the pieces in half.  We read reviews that stated they don't use much rice on the nigiri, and that turned out to be true, but the rolls were piled with rice then flattened and compressed by the sushi chef.  It looked thin but it was very dense.  That is a little trick to make it look thin when it is not.  We also noticed that they use the same top garnish on a lot of their sushi and it makes a lot of the food all taste the same. The sushi chefs had little or nothing to say and were generally unfriendly.  If you said anything to them, they pretty much ignored  us.  However, the friendliness of our waiter was much welcomed.\n\nWe had salmon belly, mackerel, towering poke, Stuffed Tomatos, seafood salad, screaming O, sashimi roll, sweet shrimp (only one piece per customer), something wrong roll, and a red dragon roll.

Thank you to all the previous reviewers.\n\nThis place was a little hard for me to find, but then again....I'm not a local.  I'd classify it as a \"hole in the wall\", but all across America, they are oft times the best places to visit.\n\nThey open at 1130 during the week.  They were a little slow to open and the front of the store was full of hungry patrons.  But....it was well worth the wait.\n\nI sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the different chefs plying their trade.  My chef was Jose. He was very pleasant and skilled at his craft.\n\nI ordered 4 of the Tuna Nigiri.  It was thick cut and had  a small dollop of rice under it.  I know a lot of people complain that Sushi Restaurants use too much rice.  I personally would have preferred a bit more.  The tuna was OK.  But not as flavorful as other sushi restaurants I've been to.  I didn't really like the thick cut with the small amount of rice.  I guess some people would call that \"splitting hairs....?\"\n\nOne thing I liked since I had chosen the AYCE lunch was the rolls were four pieces.  That gave me an opportunity to try more varieties. \n\nThe Orange Blossom Roll was a tempura shrimp roll.  It had a wonderful sweet flavor. It was tight and perfectly sized for one bite enjoyment. All their rolls were like that.\n\nThese two you've got to try...!\n\nThe Playboy has seared salmon on top with cream cheese and eel sauce.  Un-Freakin  believable!\n\nThe Baked Lobster Roll was everything as delicious as the Playboy.  EVERY BIT!  And the name of the roll speaks for itself.

At $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner, I find it to be quite a bargain even if the quality isn't necessarily the best.\n\nI came during the mid-afternoon and found a fair number of diners in the venue, but also plenty of open seats, so I had no issues with long waits. You can order three items at once, and they turned out my selections amazingly fast.\n\nEach order of nigiri has 2 pieces which only multiples the feeling that you're getting an abundance of food at an awesome price. OK, items like the salmon, surf clam, red snapper, and eel didn't taste like the freshest cuts ever. In fact, there was an overall sogginess to both the fish and the rice, and some of the pieces came drowning in sauce, but they didn't taste \"off\" or awful either. Maybe the fact that I experienced no discomfort or food poisoning afterwards is a low hurdle to clear, but nothing about the fish or their preparation methods was alarming or concerning.\n\nIf you like saucy rolls, whether spicy, sweet, or both, you'll definitely have a blast here. Again, it's AYCE, although in general some selections are not available during the slightly cheaper lunch hours. Hot items like the chicken karaage and bulgogi beef were just a tad excessively fried or doused in sauce, respectively, but again in this one case I'm willing to sacrifice a fair bit of quality and authenticity in exchange for the sheer quantity.\n\nBetter yet, they were running 2 for 1 drink deals when I stopped by. So two back-to-back beers were a great way to wash things down.\n\nI've had my fair share of super high-end sushi and Japanese fare and am therefore willing to pay up accordingly. But I can also appreciate what a good value places like Sakana offer even if the quality isn't first-rate. Overall, for me this was a decent, fully satisfying experience.","date":"2017-12-06 02:38:48"}

I just told her do you know it's my birthday. She still had an angry look on her face. As she picked up the plates she angrily and insincerely said, \"well happy birthday.\" Like seriously, I can't believe she just said that. It ruined my night. I guess the manager noticed her rude behavior so he decided to take over and serve our table. He was extra nice to us afterwards and he ended up not charging us for leftovers. I give him props for handling our table appropriately. He did a great job. As for the waitress, I don't know how he handled her. Oh did I mention they didn't give us the correct order for our table.

However, I can always stop by for dinner.  Eric R. and I went here this past weekend prior to my dropping him off at the airport.  We were seated at the bar in front of Chef Sai and also Chef Dragon (truly a cool name!) - the service and interaction with the sushi chefs was remarkable.  Our server was on the quiet\/shy side, but she was certainly nice and refilled our drinks as needed.  The only app I ordered was the shishito peppers, which were teeny tiny but tasty and covered with bonito flakes.\n\nWe had a lot of sushi options.  I nearly passed out when I saw the specials board read \"YUZU YELLOWTAIL BELLY\" but alas, no belly in stock.  Instead, we got salmon belly so that is a fine swap.  There is a delicious yuzu sauce similar to Monta Chaya's drizzled on sushi like tai.  We got whole scallop that was slightly seared via blowtorch also.  Eric R. was happy because he could order half rolls of many kinds of rolls to try.  I got a salmon skin handroll which was delicious.  I did not see handrolls on the menu but Chef Sai happily obliged.  I got amaebi which did not come with heads initially but were happily given upon request.  We also got the cocaine which is a super spicy sauced sashimi salad.  The sauce has habanero oil and gave my nose a nice run hehehe.  Saba is house cured and very tasty. \n\nChef Dragon gave us an assortment of the freshest of the day for us to try, including, sake, escolar, maguro, and hamachi.  I also got tako with lemon (asked for sesame oil but it may have been misheard).  I ended with the super rich dessert uni with quail egg.  The quality was quite good.  The ambiance is very different from its predecessor Kabuki, and it is painted dark and is a bit funky behind the sushi bar, with pictures and written menu like Ichiza's walls.  Great conversation with sushi chefs.  I will return.","date":"2013-09-12 18:28:58"}

Upon entering this god given place you're immediately greeted by everyone and seated quickly, which is nice. I like getting noticed and eating right away hehe. The decorations are pretty generic same as every other sushi restaurant nothing special. As for wait times my friend and I came in at 8 and were seated immediately. If you're just coming with two people just seat at the bar its so much better trust me! When you order some rolls the chef can just immediately hand it to you instead of waiting for a server to bring it over. We left around 9:30 and the place started to get popping, so wait times can be not steady.\n\nThe servers here are so nice and on top of it!!! They would always ask if I was okay, if I wanted any more appetizers and rolls. The guy who was making my sushi (sai) was no exception to this too. He treated us very well, and made our sushi quickly after we ordered. \n\nSoooo lets start with the appetizers! What a breathe of fish air seeing new food at ayce sushi! We got some staples first; shrimp tempura, pork belly, and edamame. The shrimp tempura was lacking in flavor to be honest. The pork belly on the other hand is so goddamn good, so freaking fatty jkasdl;fj;ksdaasd;kj yum. \n\nMoving on to their different types of appetizers the Bul-go-gi nacho! What a presentation masterpiece! It comes with in four nacho typa things with some fish and other spices on top. Definitely would order again. The japanese nacho on the other hand wasn't to my liking. I was a fan of the beef on top but not so much of the sauce they juiced it with it was a bit too much. Oh btw unlimited mochii hehehe. Their coffee mochi is really strong though so beware!\n\nFor sushi I feel like this places thrives more on presentation than most other ayce sushi. Every roll that comes out are all instagram worthy. And all were 10\/10. We ordered tons of sushi so I can't go through every one we ordered. They were all exceptional. But the two that were the best was the jackpot roll and special white tuna. The jackpot roll is decorated with a bunch of sprinkles so it looks like a cereal but do not underestimate it's greatness. Do your taste buds a favor and introduce them to something out of this world :)\n\nPRO TIP! If you're just coming with TWO PEOPLE SEAT AT THE BAR its so much better trust me! AND GET THE SASHIMI SALAD!!!!!\n\nI honestly would not change anything about this wonderful wonderful place. It's officialy my new ayce sushi favorite.

Yes. That's how much fish they give you. Of course, this would mean nothing if the fish quality wasn't also very good. I realized last night that it's the perfect ratio. I enjoy sashimi, but I couldn't do all-you-can-eat without requesting a bowl of rice. At Sakana, I felt like I was eating a long cut of sashimi with a little bit of rice attached for good measure.\n\nThere are a couple things Sakana does that are a little different. First, they serve uni in basic nigiri format as opposed to gunkanmaki (I found that on wiki); in other words, they don't wrap it in nori. That's not a bad thing. Second, rather than give you a whole salmon kama, they serve it up as bite size portions. Not necessarily a bad thing but worth noting.\n\nAYCE sushi dinners are usually a blur. Rather than try to list everything I remember enjoying, I'll just refer you to Tony T's photos. And of course, I cannot forget about dessert. They have the staples like mochi and tempura ice cream, but I decided to get the less common Green Tea Panna Cotta and the Black Sesame Blanc Manger. Both were a great way to cap the dinner.","date":"2013-09-20 17:08:42"}

Shout-out to my Yelp pal Gregg W. who just happened to stroll in while we were chowing down!    \nThe ambiance is casual but their food is totally upscale.  I was amazed at how quickly the food came out!  Seriously we must not have waited 2 minutes for our food and it was all hot and fresh and delicious.   \nItems selected: \nScallop & bacon skewer- Delicious.  Bacon was crispy and scallops were tiny but sumptuous.  \nShrimp tempura- Best I've ever had.  Hot, crunchy, salty, delicious.  I could eat them all day. \nThe shit- wonderful.  Spicy, crunchy, hot, crabby.  I wanted 20 more immediately. \nEdamame- Best I've ever had.  Piping hot, salty, perfectly steamed. Yassss.  \nChicken fried rice- Wonderful flavor.  Good size portion for AYCE.  \nJapchae- Stir-fried glass noodles with shredded carrots.  Delicious flavor and piping hot. \nPang- YUCK.  Tastes like hot mayo and crab.  Not for me.  Gagged a little bit. \nSomething wrong roll- The first sushi I've ever liked.  I'm go glad I tried it.  It had tuna, salmon, and shrimp tempura.  If you go, you have to try this.  I loved it. \nMini honey toast- Amazing.  Toasted block of bread with honey and ice cream.  Get five of these.  The ice cream is something special...it's super white vanilla (like the inside of a Klondike bar).  \nGet your ass down here if you like sushi...or even if you don't (like me).

We've eaten at most of the AYCE Sushi joints here in Las Vegas, but this one has got to be the worst one by far. Walking into the restaurant, we were greeted with a lousy Hello, after the server came to talk to the party of four who by the looks of it were waiting a while as they asked if they could just sit at the bar with their kids. The server never asked how many were in our party, although we were told to write our name down on a list, he never once looked at. The restaurant was not busy. And as a server, I know busy. Also my boyfriend and I were the only ones waiting. We look around the room and there's clearly seats for where we can be placed. (There's a two-seater right in front of me.) Patience. We wait. 15 min. We get seated to the exact same two-seater that's been vacant since we got there. The server comes to our table asking what we want to drink, and takes our drink order as he's walking off to do another task. Why was he in such a hurry when he only had 3 tables to serve. Water, took 10 min to come. Because he was in such a hurry, our Beer came out wrong. Orders sent to the wrong table. Extra ginger took about 10 min. A different server had to come and take our order because our server was too busy doing who knows what. And on top of what, my boyfriend wasn't even finished with his food, but our servers hand was already on the plate to bus. Seriously? \n\nAlthough service was horrible the rice to fish ratio was good. They get 1.5 stars from me because food came out fast and it was fresh although they drown their fish in too much sauce for my liking. \n\nI guess our server, Jason, was just too busy with his 3 tables that he was just too busy to place his two feet down next to our table without moving just for a couple of seconds to ask if everything was okay. \n\nI will never be going back.","date":"2015-06-26 22:15:36"}

Sakana is located off strip but it's a short Uber ride away. I had heard from friends having a great experience at AYCE sushi in Vegas and thought why not give it a try. After reading up on a few different AYCE sushi places, I decided to go with Sakana because of the variety & good reviews.\n\nSakana is open 7 days a week: \n+ AYCE Lunch $20.95 (11-3:30 pm) \n+ AYCE Dinner $25.95 (3pm - midnight)\n*Pro-tip: even if you arrive during lunch hours, ask to pay for dinner prices since there are items that are only included in the dinner menu and not offered during lunch. Definitely worth the $5 price difference.\n\nAs for the food, it was all surprisingly very fresh sushi. The \"No-Rice\" section and select nigiri (salmon belly, oyster, uni, and ama ebi) can only be ordered once and only during dinner (this is where that $5 difference for dinner even if you arrive during lunch hours pays off!). From the \"No rice\" section, I tried the seafood salad, sashimi roll, & stuff tomato. All were very good & fresh although I think I would've preferred to ask for the sauce on the side because it was drowned in spicy ponzu sauce which can get a bit heavy.\n\nThe nigiri was good.. I really enjoyed the salmon, tuna, & yellowtail. The Super white tuna was good but again that sauce was a bit too much for me.. I prefer to taste the fish. I decided to try their hand roll & opted for the Batman Burrito which came wrapped in green soy paper. Big mistake as it was so packed full of rice with very little fish that I was instantly full after eating it. Sadly after the Batman Burrito there wasn't any room for dessert although I already had my eyes set on either the Affogato (vanilla ice cream w\/ Korean style coffee) or Green Tea Panna Cotta.\n\nStaff is diligent in making their rounds, clearing empty dishes, and asking if you'd like to order more. It's a great spot for groups (they have 2 for 1 special on alcohol all day, 7 days a week). They accept credit cards but not Amex.","date":"2017-12-09 01:14:18"}

It's hidden away in the corner so not many can see it, which is good for me since Yama gets super busy.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the sushi chefs are very nice. I've been there twice, once with a large party and the other time with just a friend and I, and have received great service on both occasions. Their sushi is fresh and melts in your mouth. My favorite is the Salmon Lemon roll, it's like crack. What I love even more is the their prices are great. $20.95 for lunch and their dinner is $24.95, which is cheaper than Yama's.

The service is usually pretty fast too! They just keep it coming. The servers come around quite frequently to ask if you'd like more food & they bring it out just minutes after ordering! Their dessert is pretty good! It's $25.99 for all you can eat. They have a specialty dessert menu in which you get to choose only one thing and then they have ice cream which you can eat as much as you want. They have red bean ice cream (which I'm not a fan of) and green tea ice cream which is delicious! They used to have a flavor called \"plum\" which didn't actually taste like plum, but I absolutely loved it. It was my favorite and I recently noticed it wasn't on their menu anymore. I asked about it and unfortunately... The vendor just doesn't make that flavor anymore. The only down fall I would say is that they don't have a soda fountain.

Extremely kind employees (everyone as in everyone who comes out to the tables, not just waiters\/waitresses). For a third of one of my visits, i think a chef was taking our order at our table. He was energetic. I like it! It was a bonus appetizer that pumped us up because we felt super welcome. One time a guy took my plate although there was still one nigiri left. He realized before walking more than 3 feet away and returned it immediately. The fish color blends in with the plate i had it on..so i dont blame him! It was a funny moment. Why would i be mad over something that was NOT pure ignorance or rudeness? But EH. some customers are just too bratty to appreciate the good points. -cough- my sister, dad, a few buds. -cough- There were two occasions i had the middle-aged waitress and she's awesome to have if you're not the type of customer who has a royalty mindset and gets offended over every little thing in the world. Dont get me wrong though, i'm not a pushover xD. My friend went cray cray with the second round of orders and the waitress asked us if we were sure we could finish. Turns out my friend couldnt finish (i warned my friend i couldnt help them) and we got very very lowkey gently lightly scolded by the waitress (sorry. Trying to be precise with what i mean). Thank you for taking care of us! We will be backkk","date":"2014-11-19 23:11:21"}

The portions of fish are huge and always delicious.  Hubby and I visited Japan last year and are now obsessed with nigiri.  This is the only AYCE that delivers anywhere near that same quantity and quality of fish.  Every other place fills you up with a mass of rice and only a tiny bit of fish, but this place finally does things properly!  The mix of Korean and Japanese appetizers are pretty good and all the desserts we've tried have been tasty.  The restaurant itself is decorated to the gills and absolutely BLASTING K-pop music.  The lines on the weekend nights are out the door so be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large group.

Maybe this place is amazing on a Thursday or Friday night, but don't bother coming here on Sunday because you'll just be eating the weekend leftovers. Most of the nigiri that we ordered was mushy and drenched in all kinds of sauces. If I'm ordering nigiri, I want to eat it the traditional way and dip it in soy sauce myself. All the rolls are creative and fun, but again everything is covered in crazy sweet sauces and it feels like overkill. \n\nLastly, the waiters never brought some of what we ordered and then brought us stuff we didn't order.

People keep coming back for more! This was our first visit but definitely not our last.\n\nHubby ordered the AYCE and I, not being able to eat as much, ordered à la carte.

It was deep fried and yummy beyond words!\n\nI also had the Towering Sashimi Poki (4-pc) which is assorted fish, crab on wonton with ponzu, spicy mayo and eel sauce. OHMYGOD that was good too!\n\nFor the AYCE, basically you can get everything on the menu with small exceptions which the waiter will tell you. Other than that, you can choose what peaks your interest. The only thing is, you have to eat everything you order. No left-overs allowed and you can't take it home with you.

We got there right at 11 as they opened for lunch, the adults decided on the AYCE which was $20.95 and the kids got individual plates.\n\nAll I had to do was read Antonia R's and my trusted yelpers reviews to steer me in the right direction on what to order. We started with seaweed salad, edamame, gyoza and shrimp tempura. Then moved on to their nigiri's: Salmon, Garlic tuna, Yuzu yellowtail and my favorite salmon belly! OMG I'm salivating right now just talking about it. It was so buttery, melt in your mouth goodness! As many have mentioned, the fish to rice ratio is incredible! Of the rolls we tried, I liked the lobster roll and Hawaiian roll the best. I had their salmon skin roll extra crispy and that too was amazing! The bulgogi nachos I wasn't a fan of, it was way too sweet and the flavors didn't meld well. My son got a curry plate with chicken katsu. My daughter doesn't eat curry so we got her just the rice and pork tonkatsu but they still charged us as if we got the curry plate (just a TIP: they don't offer katsu plates, so if you want that, you have to order the curry plate minus the curry and pick either chicken katsu or pork katsu as a topping for an extra $2 and $3 respectively) \n\nThe service was great up until about an hour after they opened when it started getting really busy, it took over 30 minutes for us to get our baked mussels, I didn't care so much as I was bursting in the seams at that point. For dessert I got the green tea panna cotta which was just ok and the honey toast with honey cream inside topped with ice cream, which was awesome.

They push several appetizers on their menu as \"must try\" - I tried to ask what was in the Pang and The Shit but not only did the waiter not answer me, he put them into our order and we were forced to eat (or pay extra for without eating) both apps which turned out to be all fake crab. I was just asking about them, NOT ordering them!\n\nNearly every roll has fake crab in it. Ordered the King Lobster roll because it did not list crab as an ingredient, but not only did it have crab, it did not have lobster. Even with asking for sauces on the side, the rolls were also all sweet so we gave up on them after a while and concentrated on nigiri.\n\nNigiri was okay though the rice ratio is off. A lot of people like it this way but it is far from authentic. With the long slice of fish leaving a tail that hangs off the little round ball of rice, they look like sperm. (I did notice that the more we ordered the bigger the balls of rice became, but that could have been a coincidence.) The salmon was the best fish they had. The super white tuna (ono) was both pretty good too. Unagi and yellowtail were fine, nothing special. Tuna and albacore were so-so. Ocean trout was stringy. We liked the two seared salmon items, but the garlic tuna and the 300 albacore tasted too similar. We were here for lunch so did not get the dinner-only salmon belly, oyster, uni or amaebi.\n\nMini udon was good - the broth was a little on the sweet side, but the noodles were nice and chewy, not overcooked at all.\n\nAgedashi tofu was okay. Flavor profile of the sauce was off and the breading was a little too thick for agedashi.\n\nI'm not usually much of a sweets person but the dessert may have been the best part. Both the green tea panna cotta and the black sesame blanc mange were very firm and not too sweet. Both had developed a skin on top, so if you like pudding skin you'll like this. I don't know if they changed the policy since that other guy's review where he was able to order unlimited desserts, but we were only allowed one per person.\n\nUnlimited refills on $1.50 iced tea. They have regular and green, and both can be unsweetened.\n\nI didn't see any signs about the free drink with review. All I saw was a sign saying they could only split bills into 6 checks per group.\n\nThe ladies' room was painted in fake Hello Kitties all over the walls. They were obviously amateur but not bad considering it was done freehand. And there was a lamp that looked like it was from Ikea - the nearest Ikea to Vegas is in West Covina, CA - my local back in LA!\n\nThey played a lot of Korean music videos, including 3 different Psy songs. They also played a Girls Generation song that sounded like they were saying \"I've got a boy on my chin\" - is this a song about having a dead conjoined fraternal twin fetus on your face?\n\nThey did let us order the AYCE lunch with 3 minutes to go before dinnertime.

After reading the reviews, I picked this spot and was not disappointed, although I'm sure we were overdressed. Didn't care though. We went later at night, around 9 pm, and the place was CROWDED. Lots of waiting people, but since we were a two-person party we got seated fairly quickly.\n\nThe four-person party to the left of us was horrid to our server, constantly throwing their hands up and complaining about how they've \"been coming here for years\" and saying that there were ingredients on their sushi rolls that was never there before, or asking why it's \"spicy\" when it was never spicy before. One such item clearly listed it was spicy in the menu. I felt sorry for our server but he at least didn't allow himself to be bullied. \n\nWe were as easy to handle as we could make ourselves. There were constant checks on how we were doing by our server, the busboy, and other servers. We shared a sake and it was delicious. We ordered four or five times throughout our time and weren't kept waiting for too long at least. There were some regulars next to us on the right side, a pair of friends who I could tell were regulars (not like the other party) because the servers all said hey to them and knew their orders. They also ordered the classy, expensive, simple stuff. Because it was our first time, I kept it pretty basic and tried a little of everything--a few fancy rolls, a basic one, grilled shishkabobs, nigiri, and sashimi. I wasn't disappointed.  \n\nExcited to come again. Highly recommend this place for the freshness and vast selection.","date":"2017-10-18 21:43:46"}

We got seated immediately because we only had a party of 2, but there was a whole gaggle of people crowding the door, waiting to get seated. \n\nSuper white tuna. This stuff was good. The ocean trout was really solid too, but you're only allowed one order per person. The crispy rice was pretty good too, but the rice was fried way too long. Overall, the sushi isn't the best quality, but it also is far from bad or fishy. \n\nThe reason I'm giving it a 3 stars is because they have random things that are limited to one order, like mushrooms and garlic, and they only have a handful of things that are actually good. I'd say most is mediocre. I also think the dinner price is way more bang for your buck, because there were so many things that are limited to dinner only. We even asked to pay the extra $5 for a dinner menu, but were denied. You don't get uni, amaebi, salmon belly, etc with the lunch price, so I'd recommend coming for dinner!","date":"2016-12-28 00:57:55"}

Everyone got all you eat except for me. I'm allergic to a lot of fish so rather than chance it I just got a few things other than sushi. The staff was not friendly at all they didn't really say much and weren't very helpful. They dropped a piece of paper for the AYCE people to fill out which was kind of hard with 12 people and one paper. They took drink orders and appetizer orders and that was all we really saw of our waiter. He refilled our water only once after having to ask multiple times. Once the food was out everything was alright. I had ordered the teriyaki chicken which wasn't very flavorful and dry. I also order the bacon wrapped asparagus which was also dry and very chewy I couldn't even eat it and I ordered the vegetable fried rice which was pretty good nothing really wrong with it but it was nothing spectacular either. Everyone who got sushi didn't really have many complaints. The one thing that was very uncomfortable was how all of the staff watched us like a hawk to make sure all the sushi was eaten because whatever wasn't eaten would be charged for. The waiter came back and took dessert orders. I had the fried banana which was probably the best thing I had ate all night but it still wasn't great. When the waiter brought our bill he charged my boyfriend and for 2 AYCE even tho I didn't do AYCE we brought it up and he fixed it although wasn't very nice about it. Everyone had paid and there was still a plate of sushi (someone in our group didn't finish) when another staff member came over and asked about it our friend told him we had already paid and he got mad and said we should've been charged but he was mad at us like it was our fault we weren't charged. Very unprofessional and awkward. The place was alright but nothing out of this world like everyone has said. My boyfriend thought the sushi was pretty good but has had better.

This is hands down the best all you can eat sushi place. Ever.\n\nMy friend and I , totally starving, with our eternal craving for sushi. We saw the reviews on yelp, and figured 'Hey, why not?' The place is located all the way in the back corner of a shopping plaza. It's signs all say Kabuki, and not gonna lie, it seems a tad bit ghetto from the outside. We judged the book by it's cover, and were actually gonna go somewhere else.\n\nSoooooo glad we didn't. We ordered at least 200 bucks worth of sushi, but only spent 46 dollars! They have a rule where you can't bring leftovers home or they have to charge you for each plate you bring home, which makes sense they don't wanna get robbed, especially considering the steal they already offer. We ended up having 6 whole plates of food left at the end of the night. They let us take the whole meal home, AND only charged us for one of the plates.\n\nThe waitresses were all too cute, and sweet. Very attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back! Would recommend to anybody with a wish for a sushi fulfillment!\n\n\nPs when we were there they played a Maroon 5 CD on repeat, so if you hate that band, better watch out ;)","date":"2013-11-24 06:22:28"}

The only aspects I don't like are the ordering system and service (because of the ordering system). Usually, you get a piece of paper and mark the quantity of each item you want; here, you have to tell your server your order, which can be pretty extensive. Because of the ordering system, you could expect the service to be slow and hectic. We asked for sriracha sauce three times to three different people before finally giving up. It wasn't until the end of our meal that someone remembered and brought it to us. \nHowever, these little complaints are completely overshadowed by the sushi. The fish just melts in your mouth! I also appreciated the fish to rice ratio. We also got the baked lobster roll...x 5. This was one of my favorites (tied with salmon, of course). I noticed some sushi places I've been to in SoCal give less and less lobster with each order, but not here! The food here was consistent with every order.

I love the fish to rice ratio where this place does not overly fill each roll with fish, great stuff. The nigiri yellowtail was on point. My sister and I ordered the Amigo roll, yellow tail hamachi, baked lobster roll, and fried California roll. I'd definitely pass on the baked\/fried rolls next time and pick the fresh rolls instead. Baked rolls gets me full much faster.\nA perfect way to end the night was with a mini honey toast dessert.

Too bad I live in SoCal and am only in Vegas once or twice a year.  \n\nCONS: My only real complaint is the method of ordering. I'm accustom to ayce sushi places that have you mark down on a piece of paper what you want to order. This place makes you order with the server which doesn't seem bad but because it's an ayce sushi place, I like to order a bunch of things at once and plan out my meal. With such a big menu, it's time consuming and inefficient to sit there with the server and go through the menu one item at a time and pick out what I want now and what I want later in my meal. \n\nPROS: Okay, enough negative talk. Let me tell you why I love this place. First of all, the food is great. I love their attention to detail. Most ayce sushi places serve fish in bulk so they throw fish on rice and push it out as fast as they can. Not at Sakana. All fish looked beautifully cut. And for some, they add garnishes that complement the fish (it doesn't mask the flavor of the fish either). I ordered the baked mussels and noticed they shuck the meat off the shell before baking. This allows you to slurp it right off the shell instead of having to pull the meat off yourself. I also noticed good cuts on fish and garnishes. Little things like these separate this place from other ayce sushi places. They're definitely not lazy here. They don't cut corners. They go the extra mile to make sure the dining experience is enjoyable in every way. Even the wait staff was on it. My water was always full. Even when I poured my entire glass into my hydroflask, they were right there with a refill. I'm excited to come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. It's literally the one thing I look forward to the most right now. Follow up review coming once that happens.","date":"2018-07-14 18:26:59"}

One of my favorite things is sushi and here's a new place to try.\n\nI went here with a group of Yelpers (thanks Tony!). Signage still says Kabuki and even the tea cups still say Kabuki as well. It's easy to miss if you didn't know this place exists. It's in the Target complex on Maryland and Flamingo.\n\nWe tried a bunch of nigiri, rolls, desserts, etc. My favorites out of everything we tried were pink scallops, sashimi salad, salmon belly nigiri, wasabi tobiko nigiri, unagi nigiri, soft-shell crab, black sesame manger, plum ice cream and green tea Panna cotta.\n\nThe pink scallops were fresh and topped with roe. Sashimi salad has shrimp tempura, tuna and salmon. Salmon belly nigiri was nice and fatty. Wasabi tobiko was pretty and yummy. Unagi was nice and smokey. Uni is served differently here. The rice isn't wrapped in nori with the uni on top. I've been a recently-converted soft-shell crab fan - I've had one too many bad soft-shell crabs back in the day that didn't deserve my precious allergic reaction time. Theirs is lightly breaded, crispy and yummy.\n\nThey have a good selection of desserts which are all great. For AYCE, it's only less than $25\/person for dinner. That's really cheap for quality sushi.","date":"2013-09-22 01:56:12"}

There are a couple expensive ones on the Strip that are great but pricey, and otherwise there are very few spots that I like in a more affordable price range.\n\nSakana, however, far exceeds my expectations. The chefs will talk with you, they're very friendly, and offer excellent recommendations. If you ask for whatever is good that day, you will get some great sushi, and it won't be the same every time either. I've already been here 3 times since I found out about it a month ago, and each time I've been served a different array of dishes, every single one of them outstanding.\n\nBut the most impressive thing about Sakana is that they actually cook great sushi rice. This is very rare for sushi restaurants in Vegas, and in my opinion makes a huge difference in the quality of the meal.\n\nOn top of the excellent food and chefs who I love, the prices are fantastic. At $22.95 for all-you-can-eat dinner as well as 2-for-1 beers during happy hour, the check will be about the same as any other all-you-can-eat sushi place in town, but the meal will be a hundred times better.\n\nI urge you to sit at the sushi bar. The chefs are engaging and entertaining, but they will give you time to talk among yourselves when appropriate. And if you're adventurous (or already know how amazing it is), order quail egg, because it's one of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere.","date":"2013-09-18 23:33:22"}

The variety was some of the best that I've had at any ayce sushi place (good variety of rolls, nigiri, appetizers, etc), and the quality of fish was really good.\n\nOne of the biggest problems at sushi places is that the ratio of rice-to-fish is not right. For the really cheap places, there will be little fish and way too much rice. Other places will have tiny rice peaces that doesn't balance out the fish. This place has the PERFECT ratio in my opinion.\n\nLastly, dessert was phenomenal. We had the ice cream on toast, the green tea panna cotta, and the affogato, all of which were fantastic.\n\nService was great, no complaints. There were only 2 waiters and they managed to serve almost a full house.

They joked with us as they waited and it was very nice in the way they made sure we were out of any danger. After that we ordered and enjoyed our time at the restaurant and this time called a cab to take us back to the hotel she was staying at. I truly love this place and recommended it everytime someone asks for a place to go.","date":"2016-06-06 18:21:30"}

With so many AYCE sushi spots in Vegas, we just had to take a chance because we didn't know which one to pick from all the great reviews.  Finally decided on Sakana and it was a chance worth taking.  Let me put it out there right now that I don't normally eat the raw stuff.  I tried it a few times but I'm not a fan so I'm speaking from the point of view of someone who only enjoys cooked rolls.  They have a variety of rolls and the boyfriend and I loved them.  They also have this appetizer called \"the shit\", which is really weird when you order it, but it lives up to its name.  SO GOOD -- just try it!  We put in for several orders of it.  The servers are also very friendly and attentive.  The only thing I didn't like about the place is that it was fairly warm that night and I don't know what was going on with their AC.  Other than that, we loved the place so much that before we headed back home to Cali, we hit up Sakana one last time!","date":"2014-07-19 21:31:43"}

Sakana wasn't too big of a restaurant, but it was spacious enough and not too crowded mid-afternoon when I visited. The interior decoration felt very sea-themed to me, and after all, \"sakana\" does mean \"fish\" in Japanese. \n\nI opted for the AYCE dinner (dinner is anything after 3PM). The price is reasonable (~$26 before tax), and includes everything on the menu. Some of the more premium items are only available to order as part of AYCE for dinner, and are limited to one order. I also found out when I received my bill that drinks are NOT included (had I known, I would not have ordered both hot tea and lemonade). \n\nService was efficient and generally friendly. When one of my orders arrived as a roll instead of a hand roll, they remedied the situation without giving me a hard time. They are also very observant and quick to clear finished plates, since all the servers work as a team (I may have had a primary waiter\/waitress, but placed orders with multiple people and had sushi brought out by different people as well).\n\nThe food was pretty decent for AYCE sushi, and there were definitely some unique items on the menu too. In particular, some of the nigiri cuts were quite big portions of fish, and the rice ball underneath is relatively small. The food came out relatively quickly as well. \n\nThere were some Korean dishes on the menu, and Kpop playing on the TVs, so I would safely assume that this restaurant is Korean-owned. Several of the servers and even a few sushi chefs were Latino, so it's a very multicultural staff, haha.\n\nI was struggling at the very end to finish the last few pieces of two rolls, as they charge for leftovers. I was able to finish in the end, though didn't ask if they offer half-sized portions for rolls.\n\nDecent variety of dishes + reasonable price + above average quality = solid AYCE sushi. You can also order a-la-carte if you desire, though if you are hungry, AYCE is definitely much better value.","date":"2016-12-13 05:32:23"}

I am a bit behind on my review writing so I will try to include the highlights, or lowlights as it may be, from my memory. I was eagerly anticipating a spectacular birthday lunch based upon the reviews and the pictures taken. Unfortunately, I was sadly dissapointed and actually left hungry, which is saying a lot for an AYCE place. There were only a couple other tables there at lunch. There was only one waiter which made service incredibly and painfully slow. In anticipation of how long it would take to get our order, as we thought the response time from when we sat down was indicative of the service, we ordered a mass amount of sushi initially - probably 4 orders of nigiri, 4 hand rolls and three cut rolls. There were four of us. Waiter consistently forgot about 1\/3 of our orders. My friend must have requested the same hand roll about four times and still didn't get it by the time we left. Also, the specials on the board were not available at lunch - so be careful this was one of the reasons we came were some of the specials. The fish to rice ratio was decent but if they forget 1\/3 of your orders I am sure they can afford to cut the rice down on what they serve. The sushi in and of itself was okay, nothing memorable and pretty standard. I would avoid \"the shit\" despite the accolades provided by other yelpers it was nothing more than a fried mess. After about two hours of fighting through this horrible experience we finally left - we didn't get dessert because we were on \"lunch\" and were already really late and just couldn't take the agonizing service anymore. It was the perfect storm of forgetful slow waiter, slow sushi chef and being understaffed. I dont' know if the other yelpers came at night and the staff gears it up for the evening but my experience is one I hope to never repeat again in my life. Also, be warned that they didn't provide soda fountain drinks, if you buy a soda it is just a can. Also, the green iced tea is not brewed (despite the representation that it was) and is merely a mix, this was apparent by not only the taste but the mix floating around in the drink. \n\n So so sad that I wasted my birhday lunch here...","date":"2014-08-01 19:21:09"}

It not only has a nice and fun atmosphere, the service is usually quick, the wait to be seated isn't long, and the food and drink are the best. \n\nThe price is like all the rest around town $25\/pp for all you can eat appetizers, nigiri, sushi rolls and dessert (lunch is a few bunch cheaper but you can't get a few of my favorite items at lunch); and the drinks are around $8\/each but it's buy one get one free. \n\nI love this place because they have items that many other places don't have like the salmon belly and ocean trout nigiri (@ dinner only, but a must have). Their nigiri is great because they don't put a lot of rice with the fish that they serve.\n\nTheir rolls are great too; my favorite being the Something Wrong Roll (Shrimp Tempura and spicy Soft Shell Crab inside, with Tuna, Salmon and White fish on the outside in a garlic ponzu sauce). I like their rolls because it's not like a lot of other sushi places where the inside of the roll is almost always that fake crab\/mayo\/gross mix lol. \n\nThey also have a large selection of soups, salads and appetizers all of which are great. I recommend the cucumber crab salad, I usually have a few of these and of course a seaweed salad to go with.\n\nTo finish it all off they have a wide dessert selection with all the basic ice creams and mochi, plus tiramisu, tempura ice cream, honey toast and my new favorite korean coffee over vanilla ice cream.","date":"2016-12-29 19:52:15"}

By ordering the dinner only nigiri (ocean trout, salmon belly, oyster, uni, amaebi) alone, you already  easily surpass the $25.95pp AYCE price. I agree with other Yelpers in that even if you come for lunch, pay the extra $5 for the dinner only options!\n\nHighlights: salmon belly (comes with a touch of wasabi that I thought was great), unagi, amaebi, scallop, and the free salmon sashimi thing we got in the beginning (from one of the chefs who thought my friend was cute heh).\n\nI ordered a bunch of saucy nigiri as a lot of people seemed to like them (yuzu yellowtail, super white tuna w\/S.O sauce, smoked paprika salmon w\/yuzu). Personally didn't care for any of them..the sauces did not add much aside from an oily sheen to the fish?\n\nDo NOT order the Saba misoyaki - lacking in miso taste and it was not deboned. I had to fish out bones from my mouth after every bite. And I know mackerel is an oily fish but this was excessively oily...I also gave their mushroom skewer a try and was equally disappointed. Literally 1 1\/4 plain mushroom on a stick - shriveled and each quarter was the size of my thumb. Took note to avoid ordering any of their appetizers in future visits.\n\nService was friendly but kind of awkward. Our main server \"refilled\" my hardly touched water, we would get asked several times if everything was alright different people and when we told them we were just waiting on something, they seemed surprised. I really wish they would go with the system where you mark down what you want yourself rather than taking your order (we had to repeat our initial big order several times).\n\nSo why the 4 stars despite all my complaints? That fish to rice ratio!! You could literally wrap the fish around the entire rice ball and more. And for the most part, I enjoyed the nigiri I got.

Ample amounts of parking to help get you in the goodness more quickly!!!

Very polite, and were always ready and willing to serve. The place was very clean very well upkept.\n\nI called in advance to make sure we didnt need a reservation, and was seated very quickly upon arriving.. Got there around 8pm was ready to start ordering. \n\nWe ordered so many sushi plates that i think we tried just about everything!!! The lobster roll, soft shell crab, bacon wrapped kabobs, oysters(one per person, and very spicy!! But delicious!), and the bulgoki nachos were on the top of my list of recommendations. The rice\/ fish ratio was awesome and you get so much bang for your buck.. \n\nOut of all of this, the icing on the cake is that they serve FILTERED water as your complimentary drink!!!

Service and food was phenomenal! Everything came out fresh and quickly despite it being a little busy because it was dinner time. Atmosphere is cute and spacious, good for parties of 5-10. Lots of variety on the menu including desert! Everything we ate was delicious, I've never seen nigiri with such little rice ratio!! LOVED IT. I'm also a huge sweet tooth and loved that they have a variety of items for dessert that includes honey toast, deep fried icecream and AYCE ICECREAM!!!! This place has automatically become my new favorite. Price is worth it so I'll definitely be back and will recommend 10\/10 best sushi in Vegas.","date":"2017-06-22 08:27:58"}

They have a cool chalkboard that covers the front window with a list of menu items, new items, and favorite rolls written on it. In the middle of the restaurant is a cool bar like table that sits 12 people comfortably. The sushi bar sits 8 and they have 3 coool bench booth setups that can sit another 12. The ambience here is refreshing, hip and popping. Not too loud. \n\nService here is surprisingly better than the ones we get at Yuma and Kaya. Carlos walked us through our questions on some items we didn't recognize, and made great recommendations including the Dancing Eel, The Shit, and Pang. No dry glasses, and no empty plates. Kept making room for our new dishes, and on top of us when it looked like we needed more.

Salmon Kama here is small, but shoots, they have it. They have lobster apart of their ingredients, and that's a plus. Skewers not as big as some places, but is tasty.\n\n\nWe'd like to come back and try the dinner menu, but overall for AYCE, customer service, and quality, they get 5 stars from me.","date":"2015-06-27 00:44:26"}

The overall quality of the fish, and the rice to fish ratio on the nigiri was on point. We have gone back more than three times now together, and individually with other friends, and it has dramatically declined in quality, not just in food, but service. The owners are quite nice from what we have experienced, but the servers here always always always forget one or two... or three things we order. \n\nI decided to take a few coworkers here after work the other day because they were craving sushi after our long day, and after that last experience, I know personally I would never be back. Not only did they forget three of the things we ordered at our table, but they sent us two rolls we never even ordered. The quality of the fish was variable and we could tell that the yellowtail was not fresh because of its distinct smell and taste. So disappointing that their miso soups came out late and at room temperature at best without tofu. Some of the baked rolls that we ordered came out with a huge amount of mayo that overpowered the taste of the content. One of the rolls, the dragon, came out with brown avocado slices... Completely lost my appetite after eating some of the yellowtail nigiri and seeing that... This place has definitely gained some mad popularity from the first time we visited, so maybe they just don't care for quality like they used to? but, my advice... they are not consistent with the quality of the fish, the service is friendly, but extremely slow and forgetful, and overall, for what you pay, this is one AYCE sushi place i will never come bring people back to, recommend, or visit in vegas.","date":"2015-06-29 17:36:58"}

It was Saturday at 830 and all the other places had the same wait, so It was no big deal. We pulled up and put our name on the list. I was really hoping for seats at the sushi bar, but there were only 4 and they were all taken. Not a big deal - though it seemed like they could easily fit another 2 chairs up there.\n\nWe waited in line while other tables got called up - then magically, just as we were next on the list, two seats at the sushi bar opened up!  The lady came over (I assumed to take us to the seats at the bar) and much to my surprise, she grabbed the two people who were AFTER us in line and showed them to the sushi bar.  \n\nUm...what? Look, if this guy is a regular (and it seemed like he was), that's cool man - but at least make a comment to us that our table would be ready in a minute.  Or, I don't know - don't make it so obvious that you're just letting other people cut in line. \n\nConsidering that I'm sure I've been the recipient of a restaurateur's kindness more than a few times, I knew I couldn't be too annoyed...(though clearly, I was, as I'm writing this review from the restaurant).\n\nOkay - so we only had to wait another 3-4 minutes - but still, it's the principle.  The rest of the service was just okay.\n\nHere's what I liked - their rolls are very inventive. The spicy rolls are actually spicy! The drinks are all 2 for 1. The food was good.

As mentioned in multiple reviews the rice to raw fish ratio is 3 to 1 fish to rice.  This also applies to the salmon roe and flying fish eggs sushi, very generous portions of eggs.  The honey toast dessert is unique from other AYCEs and pretty good. \n\nThere were multiple times where they forgot my order and had to ask again to follow up.  I didn't think it would be so hard to get miso soup.  The same goes asking for a refill of iced and hot green tea.

Their salmon \"kama\" is not kama (fish collar).  I have never encountered kama in such whole pieces, a lot of unsuspecting and inexperienced diners won't may not know the difference.  This was disappointing, especially since they didn't have any hamachi kama available.\n\nAnother theme, greasy, greasy, and more greasy.  You can smell it when you walk in and applied to anything fried.  Expect excessive saucing on their rolls.\n\nMy \"punishment\" to keep my wife happy is going to Sushi Kaya the next day and things were much better.  Going to sushi AYCEs two days in row isn't all that bad when visiting Vegas.","date":"2017-02-26 21:03:34"}

Sakana surpasses every AYCE sushi place in Vegas in taste, fish:rice ratio, freshness, food options, alcohol prices, service and atmosphere. I lived in Japan for 16 years- I know my sushi. (Obviously it's not Japanese style sushi, but if you don't compare it to that- it's really, really good)\n1. Drive up to the Target complex on Maryland- the restaurant is on the Eastern side of Target, almost behind it. \n2. Appreciate the atmosphere. One wall looks straight off of a rustic country living DIY Pinterest board, another a Studio Ghibli and animation shrine, another a fancy teppanyaki restaurant and finally a bathroom all about Hello Kitty and everything kawaii. \n3. Start with the Baked Green Mussel appetizer. These mussels were FAT. The red sauce has a slight kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy. I could eat an entire meal of these. \n4. Fill up with nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is perfect here. The rice itself isn't necessarily smaller, but instead the slices of fish are bigger. Fresh, fresh, fresh. There's no fishy smell or the overly dyed fish you might get at other restaurant. They offered a few lake fish (non-Ocean) as nigiri, which I had not previously tried before. Interesting, but good. You won't find that in Japan! \n5. Start your AMRAP or As Many Rolls As Possible. The rolls are smaller and each roll is crafted artistically and not just thrown together. The No Name, Wet Dream, Bam Bam roll were my favorite, but there were not any rolls that I didn't like. \n6. HONEY TOAST FOR DESSERT. Need I say anymore? Sakana is the first AYCE sushi restaurant that I have seen offer this. Don't bother with the tiramisu, mochi icecream (both were good) Honey Toast always wins. \nEat, sleep, repeat. Eat, sleep, repeat.","date":"2016-02-17 18:59:57"}

I have been to Makino, Island Grill\/Sushi, Rainbow and Kobe for AYCE sushi and I can assure you, Sakana is one of the best AYCE sushi spot for its service and quality.\n\nSERVICE\nFrom reading other reviews, it seems that service here is hit or miss. Fortunately, my server (Carlos) was on top of his A game. He was not only knowledgeable, but also friendly and attentive. My water was filled the entire time and Carlos constantly checked if we needed anything. \n\nI was also pleasantly surprised by the wait time. Keep in mind, this place was packed with no empty seats at 1PM on Sunday. It literally took 5-10 minutes for all the food to get to our table. Fast, but none of the items we got were sloppy by any means. Every dish was perfectly presented. Billion times infinity and beyond thumbs up for their amazing chef and staffs. You guys rock!\n\nSUSHI\nAYCE is $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. I highly suggest you pay that extra $4 and come here at night because there are much more selections. They are not stingy with the cuts. If you look at Nigiri, you can see how thick and generous the cut is. I hate when AYCE sushi place pack ridiculous amount of rice. I'm sorry but I'm not paying over $20 to eat rice. All the sushi we got here had nice thick cuts of fish with the perfect amount of rice. Things I tried:\n\nNigiri 5\/5\nOcean trout garlic ponzu (one time only) 5\/5\nGarlic ponzu albacore 5\/5\nSpider Roll 5\/5\nYakitori 5\/5\nGarlic ponzu mackerel 3\/5\nAgedashi Tofu 4\/5\nGreen tea panacotta 5\/5\nTiramisu 1\/5\n\nI got hooked on their Green Tea Panacotta. It's made in the house and has rich matcha flavor. Super creamy and it was delightful. I got 4 of this.... #yolo\n\nPass on that Tiramisu. It was rock hard and was ridiculously sweet. Had a medicine aftertaste. \n\nCONCLUSION\nExceptional service and quality of food. I would come back in a heartbeat!","date":"2015-09-06 23:28:32"}

(Not that i saw anyway), no limits on desserts or really much of anything. Pretty generous.\n\nRolls are good and put together well, with very fresh fish, not too much rice, and just enough sauce. Nigiri sushi was excellent. Nice big pieces of fish and just a little ball of sushi rice. Excellent quality and nice selection. Apps were decent and had some different offerings including bulgolgi nachos and something called \"the shit\". Not quite sure what it was but it looked like it's name. Lol. Some kind of tempura log.  Good dessert at the end with all the various ice creams.\n\nOverall nice small restaurant. Quiet and clean. Excellent quality sushi served fast and with great customer service.

We came in around 630pm on a Sunday night and got seated right away. All in all, I highly recommend their nigiri. Their fish quality is so yummy and fresh and great rice to fish ratio. No fishy taste (except for mackerel so avoid getting that) and the rice is just right amount of vinegar, sugar, temperature, and stickiness! If you're not a fan of heavy mayo in your foods then I'd stay away from most rolls and appetizers lol\n\nAppetizers \nBulgogi nachos: 4\/5 this was a pretty good. It was heavy on the cheese and sweet mayo so it's pretty creamy if you're into that.The bulgogi in it is nothing special. \n\"The shit\": 3\/5 this was literally a deep fried California roll but without the rice lol lots of sriracha mayo inside but it was crispyyyyy \nSpicy edamame: 3\/5 has a pretty spicy kick and quite oily \nPoke tower: 3\/5 way too much mayo in this on top of tortilla chips. It was pretty much sriracha mayo topped tuna on top of crisps. At this point we had too many things with mayo, I was quite overthis lol \nBaked mussel: 3\/5 mussels were so tiny, there was nothing much to bite and it was mostly mayo and a little masago. \n\nNigiri\nLemon salmon: 5\/5 salmon was so fresh and lemon taste was just enough to complement the smoothness of the salmon. \nSalmon belly: 5\/5 so fatty, it melts in your mouth\nSuper white tuna: 5\/5 my fav of the night! I could eat this forever, it was silky smooth but wasn't tiring to eat like salmon after a while. Highly recommend this. \nGarlic tuna: 4\/5 tuna is fresh and garlic isn't too strong \nCajun salmon: 4\/5 Smokey taste to it, quite unique\nMackerel: 2\/5 was so fishy and already cooked. Don't get \nUni:3\/5 this was a hit or miss. Some pieces were so creamy and fresh. Other pieces were bitter and GROSS \nRaw shrimp: 3\/5 I feel like this is an acquired taste. It has a gummy texture and kind of mushy. \n\nDessert\nGreen tea: 2\/5 pass on this. Literally tastes like vanilla with green food coloring. Fake green tea\nTiramisu: 5\/5 coffee cake was soooo yummy. Just the right of sweetness to contrast the bitterness of the coffee.

Okay, well for starters I almost gave up since the sign outside still says Kabuki and not Sakana!  I was actually already going to take one star off for the fact I drove around and around...until I read a little yelp tip that finally led me to this treasure.  When we walked in we were immediately greeted and asked if we wanted a table or sushi bar....I said table, but the sushi bar chef yelled sushi bar at the hostess and apparently he calls the shots =P  Eating at the sushi bar was definitely an advantage, we called off our orders to the chef and he made them on the spot! \n\nFor starters this place has AYCE for $22.95...cheapest AYCE in Vegas that I know of.  So most important part of AYCE is freshness and the rice to fish ratio for the sushi.  I swear there were not more than 20 kernels of rice per piece of fish!  I would equate this to almost eating sashimi with the small amount of rice per piece.  The salmon, white tuna, unagi, seared tuna were all extremely fresh and well prepared.  Okay, so the best part is how they sear off the tuna and unagi with a blow torch....it was still piping hot when I consumed it, pure heaven! The specials that day were salmon belly and toro steak....again more bites of perfection!  We tried a few rolls that were on their dinner\/one time only part of the AYCE menu as well.  The towering sashimi poke with wonton crisps...I could have just sat there and eaten that all night, cripsy wonton shell with fresh fish and a touch of acidity....too bad we were limited to one order per person =(.  We also tried their Screaming O and the Sashimi Roll, both of which were well prepared as well.  The only thing I honestly did not like....the plum ice cream (this was slightly atrocious to be since it reminded me of the pink amoxicillin (antibiotic) medication I had as a child that they tried to disguise with some unknown flavor.  But, minor flaw given they have plenty of other options for dessert.  Make sure you look at their updated menus on the counter as well....the one that is laminated that they hand you is missing a few items.  If you love AYCE sushi....you have to try this place out.  I say comparable to Goyemon\/Sushi Mon for a lower price and less rice =)","date":"2013-12-20 16:48:44"}

The boyfriend lives sushi.  Even though I cannot eat it due to allergies, we frequent this restaurant.  They serve a great bulgogi, so that is what I always order.  After speaking with employees in the past, they have let me know that their soup also contains things I am allergic to and started serving my meal slightly differently than what the menus has. I have had a few issues with the service, but have never complained in the past because the positives have always outweighed the negatives.  Tonight there were just too many problems.  My name was on the list waiting for a table.  I was called, but rather that taking me to my table, the woman just pointed in a direction for my group to sit in.  The server comes to our table and asked for our drink order.  After hearing only my order, she walked away without saying anything else.  The lady that originally pointed to the direction of our table comes by a moment later and asks for our drink order.  \nThe original waitress comes by to take our food order.  I started to order my dish how it has been being served to me each time I come by.  She tells me no, they cannot make the changes.  I asked if this was a new change because I had been there a week prior and it was not an issue.  She told me that unless her manager said it was okay, she could not do it (in all honesty, the change they make gives me less food, but it hasn't matter since the serving size is adequate and I prefer not to waste), and the manager was not there.  I am extremely limited as to what I can eat, so I told her we couldn't dine there this evening.  After getting up, I asked one of the bussers if the it was a manager I could speak to, he said no.  I then asked for a supervisor and again he said no and walked away.  I stopped to speak with the first lady I encountered as she was by the door.  I asked her for a manager or supervisor and she tells me they don't have one there.  I explained that we had to leave and why and asked her for the managers business card so I could inform them of the incident.  She tells me that she would let them know.  I asked again for the managers card because I want to personally speak with them.  Now, she says she is the manager.  She admitted that she sees me in there often and knows my order.  She says she would talk to the waitress regarding not taking my order.  I am appalled at how there was no management around to speak with and how the lady at the end decided she was the manager after everyone said one was not there, including herself.  This experience definitely makes me not want to visit again.","date":"2016-11-19 06:09:31"}

If I could sum up sakana in 2 words, it'd be that it is a \"sushi heaven\". Thanks to all the Yelpers who posted their reviews and guided me to here. I'd like give you all a huge bear hug, because it's true that this AYCE gem is THE best of its kind. We went there around 9 on a Saturday nite and I was seriously dreading that we'd have to wait a long time to be seated, but nope. We got our table right after our host came to greet us. After that, everything was a blur of sushi bliss. We didn't get to eat anything the whole day since we were busy with all the road tripping outside of vegas so we were pretty famished when we started our AYCE ordeal. I must've ordered almost the whole sushi menu and a good number of appetizers. Within about 5-10 minutes, our food was delivered to our table in a succession of what I remembered as a delishness galore. I can't believe it. I've found what I've been looking for all my life: a place that delivers excellent quality packed in massive quantity. For the first time, the slices of fish was the main diva of the show rather than the glob of rice that usually takes up the space of the stage like in most other AYCE joints. I was astounded to see the gloriously huge pieces of fish stacked on top of a small piece of the sushi rice. And the seasoning?? Frickin fantastically spectacularly amazingly bombass diggity good. I love my fish naked and raw just as long as they're fresh, but damn, when they're dressed in a bit of that sexy ponzu and garlic or Yuzu sauces, I felt like I was hooked on ecstasy. I've never had my sushi served that way, but consider my cherry well popped coz I'm now I'm a lifelong addict for it. As for the appetizer, hot diggity damn, I do love me that pork belly. Don't get me wrong though. Just like their sushi, their appetizers were just as good, too, but I can't get over how tender and perfectly flavored that piece of meat was. \n\nWith all that said and done, all that I regretted from my experience at Sakana was that I didn't have enough appetite or room in my stomach to eat more. For the dinner price of $25 ish per person, it'd be like finding needle in a haystack if I ever find a place as good as this one. With that said, I'd be back in a heartbeat when I'm in Vegas again for sure.","date":"2017-11-12 15:48:27"}

Hands down best speciality rolls that I have ever tried. I'm not really big on Nigiri but from what I saw the rice ratio is like basically non-existent. The fish over powered the rice in all the rolls, no doubt about it! Now, for a small girl like me I love how there's minimal rice because I want to be able to eat as much as possible and let's face it, rice is extremely heavy & makes you full faster. \n\nFor rolls we got-- call 911, burn your ass roll, monkey brains, summer crunch, popcorn lobster roll, lemon salmon roll, \"the shit\", and jalapeño bomb roll. We also got beef skewer and lobster bacon skewer. \n\nI really did LOVE LOVE all the rolls I tried but My favorite roll was probably the Call 911 roll. It contained habanero so it's suppose to be extremely spicy. Yah it was spicy but it was the perfect amount. Chef Sy came out and even warned us that it was going to be the spiciest roll and to try not to call 911! LOL he was a good character. He came out and chatted a little bit with us. \n\nJalapeño bomb roll is another must get. It's a deep fried roll with cream cheese, crab & spicy tuna. There's a jalapeño on top that gives it an extra kick. Soooo good!! \n\nThere was an item called \"the shit\". It was part of the appetizer menu. It doesn't have a description but just says you must try it! So I do wanna say.. YOU MUST TRY IT! It's really good. It comes with this delicious sauce you eat it with. To die for! \n\nI really did wanna try more items but my stomach always fails me! I was so darn full! I will for sure be returning! There were dinner items on there that I really wanted to try like the \"rice less\" rolls! And the seafood salad. So next time I will be doing dinner AYCE.\n\nDessert -- green tea panna cotta and mango mochi. Green tea panna cotta is kinda like a flan but not as sweet. It is pretty good. \n\nThe staff were very efficient on taking our orders and filling our drinks. I think the waiter was a little overwhelmed though because he kept bringing us items that we did not order.

You know I had to see what all the excitement was about for myself.\n\nMe and boo thang did the AYCE (of course) and I was immediately excited when the server told us we're allowed to do half orders for rolls. Instant like. One of the first few items we ordered is salmon nigiri, which is the criteria by which I judge each new sushi spot. And the verdict is......it was aiiiite. The good, there was a whole lot more salmon than other places usually offer. The bad, it wasn't as fresh as I'd hope for. But I can't complain because the level of freshness is pretty much the same as Yama Sushi. \n\nThey offer a good selection of rolls, however they all seem pretty mediocre. But to be honest, I don't really care much for rolls anyway. A plus is that they will allow you to add a quail egg on a masago or ikura nigiri free of charge -- I've had run-ins at other restaurants where they charged me extra as part of the AYCE D': \n\nIf I'm on this side of town and Goyemon is packed, I'd definitely head over to Sakana. I even think it's safe to say that Sakana is #2 on my favorite AYCE sushi spots.","date":"2013-09-11 23:28:29"}

They had great rolls and the staff always attentive. I came back here last year and it was not as good as I had remembered from the first few times  I had been here.  We gave it another shot today. Since last time here they have expanded the restaurant, probably because of the business they now get from the 1200+ reviews that are favorable. I am not a fan of overly sauced or creamy things ( no insult to those who love  yum yum, S.O. Sauce, and the like), today everything we had, super white nigiri included was drowning in sauce. I found a hair that was obviously not from anyone at our table. I quietly told the server, and asked her to take that one away. I tried something completely different a bit later and guess what...? Another hair! The manager was consulted and my dinner was taken off of the bill. While I appreciate the effort and the profuse apologies from the servers it just felt like the food quality, cleanliness, and care really left something to be desired. I think sadly Sakana is like  so many other places that go downhill after they become well known. Sorry to say no longer in our rotation of go to restaurants.","date":"2018-05-27 01:17:54"}

Get the NIGIRI first, then fill up on the rest of the other items that take previous stomach space.  ;-)!  Also, dessert was limited to one as well so you need to some allocation analysis to fit all you want to try in this meal.  The only reason why they lost a star is that we were kept waiting nearly 15 minutes in between our meal before our nigiri sushi came out.  They had a large party before us but there were four sushi chefs working so I think they lost our order.  Our waiter came back twice and didn't see our food on the table so he went back and forth to see what was the delay.  It took the hostess to check on our food before we got something on our table.  It was very strange but I guess we had an extra 15 minutes to digest our food so we could fit MORE!!

There is a 2 for 1 special on the alcoholic drinks as well if you decide to get saki, soju, wine, beer, etc. Lunch price is fair, just a little under $21 and a little under $26 for dinner.

My favorite used to be Goyemon but they got really popular so the wait was always super long, they increased their prices to I think $26.99 for dinner and their fish to rice ratio is horrible now compared to before. Anyway...\n\nLunch ends at 3 and is only $20.95! We came at 2:30 and there were only 5 other tables in the restaurant. Service was great, sushi came out really really quick, dirty dishes were always taken away and waters were always refilled. \n\nSushi tasted fresh, and they give you HUGE slices of fish. I think my only complaint is that the fish slices should be a little less thick because it's so difficulty to shove the entire thing in your mouth. Also the sweet sauces that they use on some of the rolls can be a bit too overwhelming. Other then that, good selection of rolls, limited appetizers (get the mussels and potbelly!), not AYCE dessert but by the end of your meal you'll be too full to care I promise. \n\nThe unagi was soooo good. I tried the white tuna and didn't like it but my bf loved it, saying it's rare that an AYCE place would offer it. Of course I'm a salmon lover and ordered a bunch of salmon rolls. Yes you can order half rolls here!! Another review mentioned something about them charging extra for appetizers before dinner. That didn't happen when I went. One complaint I did have was that we had to ask for our miso soup 3 times! I thought they didn't have any but they just forgot about it. \n\nThis will be my go to spot from now on!!","date":"2016-02-20 00:26:21"}

The AYCE is okay, but hostess needs more training on seating customers. I arrived 6:30pm on a Tuesday, looking to get a table for 5. Come 35 minutes later and after seeing 4 later parties seated before us, we are still the only ones on the waiting bench. I noticed the other parties of 3, 3, 4, 4 were seated by pulling two tables together, and kindly asked her why the staff couldn't do the same for our party of 5. Mind you, I've been standing with her for the past 25 minutes and haven't received a smile from her yet - but she explains that she is waiting on a table to leave and they are about to go. And on we wait for another 10 minutes, while another 2 parties get seated before us. To my disappointment, go ahead, GUESS how she seats us? By pulling 2 tables together. Why, OH WHY didn't she do this 35 minutes ago when we were the first to arrive??!!? It takes just as many tables to seat 4 people, as it is for 5 people. Minus 1 for poor planning. But we didn't let this upset our night. We were on a mission to try the AYCE menu. Lunch is $20.95, and dinner service is $25.95. The menu is pretty extensive, and we enjoyed our meal. Plus 1 for prompt serving & refilling... Another staff member was constantly refilling our waters. There was one instance where our server brought the wrong item to our table tho, and just shrugged it off ... Minus 1. My favorite was the Red Snapper Nigiri, Tiger Roll, Chanel Roll, and Bulgogi Nachos. The rolls seemed to have a lot of sauce on it, a little too much for my preference, and the fish was okay, but not too memorable. Parties of 6 are charged 18% gratuity automatically. And there are signs about only splitting bills 6 ways for parties of 6 or greater. The ladies restroom is decked out in Hello Kitty, near to my heart. And the restaurant decor is really nice. Plus 1 for decor. I'd probably return to give it another try if they didn't punish larger parties and have us wait 35 minutes - didn't offer a water or something to drink during our wait. I watched 18 people get seated before us, and was so hungry and parched by the time we were seated :( I usually dine with my family, and this place didn't make my list of places to bring them since the long wait is just not worth it.","date":"2018-07-25 15:35:04"}

There were only 3 of us, we all did the AYCE. Food was amazing! I tried everything that's only one per person. Only thing I wouldn't get for next time is the sashimi seafood salad. It was just too much food! Some of the fish pieces were chewy. I was the only one in my party who likes raw fish so it was very hard for me to finish it all. I would have much rather ordered different nigiri. \nFirst time trying sweet shrimp and uni. The shrimp was meh- nothing I would crave again. The uni didn't look fresh, I expected it to be a yellowish color but it was more brown. Tasted sweet though and I could get use to it. \nMy favorite were the trout and salmon belly sashimi. \n\nService: they only had guys working here, and they seem to work together pretty well. \nOnly problem was they did forget a couple of items we ordered. \nEverything else was great. Attentive, fast. \n\nOnly weird part about the whole trip was how many homeless people were around. When we walked in a lady from the parking lot asked for money. Then right around the entrance a guy with a window cleaner wanted to clean our car windows. And while waiting inside another person walked toward the waiting area, reached his hands all the way down his pants and felt around for a few seconds, I thought he was going to pull a guy or knife out and attack us. I think he was align for a cup of water and they were nice enough to give him one. He asked my husband if he wanted to buy these headphones that he grabbed from his pants as he was walking out. While we were eating, about 40 minutes later, same guy came back to get his water cup refilled and looked around the restaurant trying to get eye contact with anyone so he can sell the headphones.

Mind you, it wasn't even that busy. At the very end we decided to order dessert because we were just waiting and waiting for our nigiri. Which took like 5 seconds to devour. \n\nOther than those 2 complaints.. The freshness of the food still over powered my complaints. The rice to fish ratio was amazing. The best I've seen.. Still 1 of my favorite sushi joints in town and will still probably return but hopefully they fix the seats before I come back...","date":"2015-03-02 20:56:20"}

The first time I came here I loved it. Second time I was pushing it. This last time I came, and not by choice I hated it. Right when we walked in I did not like what ever smell was going on. Second our waiter, who's name I did not get was horrible. Super rude and not at all pleasant. He was a bald asian guy with a bad personality. We got seated and he took down some appetizers from us. When we asked about sushi, he gave us an attitude and said \"I don't take the order, I will bring a piece of paper and you do it yourself\". After that incident, when he came to pick up the paper and read that we had order 8 rolls  (there was four of us). He told us in a really unprofessional way \"you guys ordered 8 rolls, that's a lot of food\". We looked at him like, \"are you for reals right now?\". Anyways after that I asked him if I can please get yellowtail with not bloodline (the red part). Omg he had a fit! He got mad and said he couldn't give me yellow tail belly and bla bla bla. When clearly he was just being too lazy to ask for yellowtail w\/ no red. I always order my yellowtail that way at any other sushi place and I never have an issue. Sushi was not bad but also not great. Maybe the good reviews come from the sign they have, if you rate them you get a free drink. I mean a lot of people would do just about anything for a free something... Just saying.","date":"2016-12-12 20:31:16"}

Decided to stop by since I was reading the amazing reviews on here! The ambiance is definitely different than all of the other sushi places we frequent. We ordered a lot of food, and majority of which were delicious! For $20.95 for AYCE lunch ($11.95 for kids), we thought it was a very good price to pay.\n\n|Appetizers|\n- Bulgogi nacho (3.5\/5): Tons of cheese, mayo, and beef. It was pretty good IMO, it's not something I would order again though since it was too sweet for my liking. My daughter obviously loved the mix of cheese, meat, and chips in one bite. \n- Spicy garlic edamame (4\/5): Second favorite spicy garlic edamame that I've tasted. They had enough spices in there. My number one favorite is at Sushi Bomb!\n- Miso soup (4.8\/5): I'm a big huge fan of miso soup, and it's something that you really can't screw up. My dad was a chef in Japan, and he makes miso soup a lot in our house. This came pretty close to it! It was also very warm when it arrived on my table (as it should!).\n- Shrimp tempura (3.5\/5): Again, my dad was a chef in Japan, so he has perfected a lot of these Japanese dishes. The shrimp tempura was alright. It was a bit soggy and fell apart when it was served to us. I get it. This isn't an authentic Japanese restaurant (it's Korean run), but if my dad, who's Filipino, can cook this to perfection the Japanese way, then so can they.\n- Dragon Ball (3.5\/5): This was definitely something else. I believe it's deep friend mushroom with lobster mix stuffing. It was good, but it lacked something. It kind of tasted a bit bland for my liking.\n- Baked Green Mussel (5\/5): Something that you absolutely cannot screw up! This was very delicious! Probably the best baked green mussel that I've ever had. They put sriracha sauce on top which gave it a nice kick.\n\n|Nigiri| (5\/5)\n- We ordered a variety of nigiri, but I wanted to rate the overall presentation, freshness, and taste to it. The fish-to-rice ratio on this is amazeballs! The fish meat is very thick, very fresh, and very delicious! They don't put too much rice with it which is a very BIG A+ for me! This contributed to adding one star to my overall experience.\n\n|Rolls| (4\/5)\n- Wet Dream: Perfect amount of flavor. The cream cheese wasn't too powerful.\n- Japanese Lasagna: ^ Same as the Wet Dream. The cream cheese wasn't overpowering the other tastes in the roll.\n- Chanel: This was alright. It was spicy, and I didn't like the fusion of the fish and spices.\n\n|Service| (0\/5)\nThis is why they only get 2 out of 5 stars in this review. The service when I was there really was lacking. You'd think that it would spectacular since there were a lot of servers there, but it wasn't. I legit didn't tip much because of how poor it was. Their reasoning was their computer was having technical difficulties. Uh... We were doing AYCE! There were also 6 other servers running around the establishment giving the customers their orders and taking the orders as well. They completely ignored us. They only came to refill our drinks and take away the plates, but they didn't ask us if we wanted more. They just walked by us and took everyone else's order around us. It was really sad, pathetic, and I left VERY furious and angry. \n\nWould I come back?\nMaybe. I'll give them another chance to redeem themselves in the far, far future. My husband wants to try this place out, so we'll see. Look for my future re-review of this restaurant. Hopefully, they get their act together and learn better customer service.","date":"2015-12-31 03:11:38"}

The worker there saw what happened and apologized, put it on a white napkin to showed the sushi chef and the server came back to the table, asked the boys if they wanted anything else and they obviously said no and brought them the check for TWO all you can eat meals! My boyfriend told the server \"I just choked on a long piece of hair, and i'm still hungry.\" So the server said sorry, sorry and took off only one meal. So my boyfriend called the server over to tell him \"Why are we getting charged? We haven't been here  more than 15 min and my friend is still hungry!\" and so the server apologized and took it off. \n\nThis is our go to sushi spot for 2+ years.

The Korean lady who i believe is the manager showed the worst customer service I have ever experienced. There were many mistakes that happened with our order but that didn't bother me much. The problem was the customer service and how the manager handled the situation which could have all been avoided with a simple sincere apology. \n\nFor example, i ordered 2 orders of unagi but was given 6 orders. That can happen, we are all humans and we make mistakes. To keep the long story short, throughout the whole time we were there, the orders were not given correctly. I don't mind that; however, the big problem was the way the Korean lady approached us. She had the courage to say to us, \"this is why you shouldn't have ordered this much food\" with attitude. First, she didn't take our order so how does she know if we ordered that much food or not. Second, she didn't even apologize for the way she treated the customers. We had no problem with the guy servers. They were very professional and showed excellent customer service. Especially as a manager, she shouldn't make accusations when she doesn't even know the facts. She needs to go through re-training on customer service. No idea how she is the manager for this place. My party and I wanted to clarify with the manager once we paid our bills in full, but she didn't want to approach us to resolve the problem.

Everything we ordered was fantastically fresh and delicious - I especially want to call out the salmon, which was not only some of the best salmon I'd had, they were also enormous pieces of perfectly-cut fishmeat, on top of the perfect amount of rice (i.e. enough to taste the rice, but really not very much). The rest of the nigiri was also excellent, I just wanted to call out how totally perfect the salmon was. \n\nI also have to call out one crazy appetizer: I forgot what it was called, but they suggested we try it, and it was amazing. Lightly cooked fish (tuna, I think) on top of mini pieces of garlic bread. I wouldn't get too much of it, as it was also clearly drenched in butter or something, so it was super filling (unlike nigiri, which is the best part about all you can eat high quality nigiri!), but also, mega delicious. \n\nService was flawless from start to finish, and the couple rolls we tried were also great (though really, with this much selection of fish this fresh, you totally want to focus more on the fresh fish).\n\nI totally loved their version of an affrogato for dessert, too (with Vietnamese sweet creamy coffee).\n\nAs long as they continue to knock it out of the park like they have up until now (this was our third time here), I will most likely continue to visit Sakana every time I'm in Vegas.","date":"2017-10-19 20:05:07"}

Plus it's only $22.95 for dinner!! Good price compared to other sushi spots around town. You know that feeling when after a few rolls of sushi that they all start tasting the same? Not here. They prepare each roll carefully and take pride in it. Our waitress, Sunny, (spelling?) has always been awesome. She's quick and efficient and always so friendly to us. \n\nThey have a good variety of appetizers and rolls. I'm not going to go over every food item, but here are a few things I always order:\n\nSashimi roll: all the fish wrapped in cucumber instead of rice with a special sauce. So yummy, healthy and delicious. \n\nSalmon skin hand roll: they don't skimp on the salmon skin. The salmon skin is cooked perfectly and crispy. Not too much rice either. \n \nNigiri (garlic tuna, salmon, salmon belly, squid): most places take a huge ball of rice and put it under a small piece of fish. The portion of rice is small compared to the amount of fish. So you actually taste the fish instead of all the rice. \n\nThe only reason why I docked a star is because they got rid of the specials menu, which had tobiko and toro on it. We asked why it was gone and Sunny said that people were too picky and didn't like it. Wtf?! How could you NOT like it? Those were my favorite two things to order!!! I was pretty sad and felt like I was jipped of my Sakana experience. I'll still come here though. :)\n\nP.S. It's unlimited dessert too!!!!","date":"2014-01-09 22:16:31"}

Super fresh, super delicious.  Still way cheaper than any other ayce in Vegas.\n\nOn their dinner specials this time around: \"Sy's Special and Dragon's Special\" .  These referred to the two sushi chef's who each made unique dishes.     I tried the Dragon special and out came salmon belly nigiri plated next to a sushi 'ball' wrapped in avocado and sushi.  Hard to describe but delicious, just check out my picture of this.\n\nLater during the dinner, SY offered his special to us.  He asked me to try it and since I didn't technically order it, they said if I didn't finish it, it wouldn't count against us.  (Since you're supposed to finish everything you order).  A whole different sushi preparation compared to Dragon's and picture must be seen below.  Of course, like the Dinner Special board had written down \"Don't ask, just try!\"  that is exactly what I did.  It was pretty good, dragon's was better imo.\n\n\nThe only 1 reason I took down a star this time around:  I ordered 1 piece of Uni which is a dinner only item.  They ran out!   Now, If I came late to dinner that would be fine, but we were the first customers there for dinner.   I guess being able to have the \"dinner\" menu during lunch time is a double-edged sword.  It's great, because I would come during lunch and do dinner, but I believe you should save some uni for your real dinner time customers.\n\nI have tried their uni in the past times I've ate here, and it was fresh.  Creamy and tasty.\n\nThe service is always nice here.  The location is right on the corner behind the Target.  They finally have their Sakana sign up after having the old Kabuto sign which they replaced.  \n\nIf you're craving sushi, and lots of it, and you don't want the quality of your sushi sacrificed, come to Sakana!","date":"2014-03-24 22:31:19"}

With that, I would have given this place a four-star but unfortunately, like other Yelpers pointed out here, the customer service needs some work. It is not that the waiters are not friendly but more that they have no idea what they are doing. Our large party made a reservation over the weekend and when we showed up, we were told that our table was given to someone else couple of hours ago and the waitress have expected them to finish in time, only that they haven't. We were cool with that since the older lady waitress did look very apologetic about the situation and the place was super busy during that time. Once we were finally seated, the server for our table started asking us what we would like to order for appetizers without giving us menus; when we asked for menu, he said they currently ran out and would get back to us. Some time later he gave us one menu for our large party where we got to share around the table. No problem, we are nice people and we were in a good mood but things just kept getting disappointing when we put in our orders but not everything was served. One of my friend who did not get AYCE was not served anything until I pointed out to the waitress. By the end of the night, we just gave up on waiting for few things we ordered more than two hours ago. On the whole, the wait time for dishes to come out was longer than other places. The lady waitress (probably the owner?) did try to make it by serving us \"special\" dishes but the overall atmosphere was just ruined by the rest of the other servers who are disorganized and have no idea what they are doing. \n\nThus, the AYCE is delicious at this place, 4\/5 stars but the customer service is about 2\/5.

When we finally made eye contact with a server, he put up his finger for us to wait. It took another 5 minutes for him to come to our table. The fish quality was a little off that night. Hit or miss at this place. \nConsidering my already low expectations of ayce sushi, I was still disappointed with this place. \nGood thing parking was ample and no wait during Sunday dinner time.","date":"2015-06-30 00:37:03"}

I wanted my review to be on a restaurant, and something to compare.  I was very happy in Sakana!\n\na.  Crowded - Oddly not very busy. Only three of us at the bar.This was at noon for lunch.\nb.  Ambiance - Very nice, trendy, and at same time comfortable. \nc.  Service - Key attribute here.  Everyone is nice and friendly and always available!\nd.  Food - Ahhh,  this is where the placed excelled!\n\n-To test the quality of this place, i chose the basics that I eat at all sushi places \n- Amai Ebi - Loved the small and delicate shrimp.  The fried fish heads were perfect, \n- Uni - Ahh, what a unique way they prepare it.  Absolutely delicious.\n\nBased on these two, the taste, texture and results were 5 star.  We also had Hamachi and Tuna both belly fat cuts. Tobiko, Mirugai,  We had a fine selection of nigiri sushi that Chef Sai made when I told him I wanted to focus on traditional sushi.  I would say, what a great chef and great choices.  We had a special tuna with jalapeno on it and that too was darn good.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed besides Chef Sai reading my mind and starting to make me some great stuff, is that all the nigiri sushi came with a very small amount of rice, so you had plenty of room for the fish.  That was awesome. I basically asked the Chef to make me some traditional nigiri sushi and I like the weird stuff, no rolls.\n\nThis place is definitely going to come to you.  Great Quality, great taste.\n\nGK says gottta come back!  This place is great!","date":"2013-12-20 05:22:32"}

Last time we were here it was so good, service was quick, and staff was so nice.  Today, however, none of this was the case.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is in it to take as much money from you as they can and don't care at all about customer service or their reputation.  There are so many other options in the area, choose one of them.\nLast time I was in, our waiter let me start with à la carte and then switch to all you can eat later on.  Today when I asked to do this, our waitress very rudely told me that wasn't allowed.  I would completely understand if I wanted to try all you can eat and then drop down to à la carte but with this, you're getting roughly $20 out of me anyway.  This woman was incredibly rude and condescending the entire time we were there.\nThey were also incredibly slow.  It was Saturday afternoon around 3PM and rather empty.  My friends and I all ordered at the same time, they got their food in about 5-7 minutes but they were ready for their second roll by the time I ever got my food.  After this, we waited about 15 minutes with empty plates before she ever even looked our direction.\nMy rolls were so sloppy I could barely pick them up.  I got a piece of one of my rolls that was literally avocado wrapped in rice and nori.  One of my friends and I each ordered half-orders of different rolls and they put them on the same plate as if it was the same roll.\nSakana was so great last time we went that I was so excited to go today; major letdown, unfortunately.","date":"2018-04-01 03:03:03"}

Sakana was great until our last experience. I had ordered nigiri garlic tuna and the fish was a darker color and very thick cut. Did not taste fresh at all, our sushi rolls had way too much sauce on them maybe trying to mask the flavor. Customer service lacked as well, one of the servers (had a beard with glasses) kept coming up to the table staring us and walking away totally creeper status made us feel uncomfortable. And to top it off there was a hair on my food. Instead of having the manager apologize and offer a discount or waive the drinks he stated that it happens all the time and it's not under their control, like I'm sorry what? It happens all the time? Like is said instead of apologizing all he did was offer an extra dessert. \nHow unprofessional is that, especially coming from the owner of the place.

Can't beat that!\n\nTHE MEAT:  We went in for lunch on a Wednesday and were 1 of the only 2 tables there.  Our server was so friendly and attentive and the food came out in good time and pace.  The soft shell crab was light and served with a tasty ponzu sauce.  \"The shit\" (crab and cooked salmon in nori, deep fried and served with yum yum sauce) didn't quite live up to its slang name (I wonder if they chose it for its aesthetic resemblance).  The salmon kama was presented beautifully (as all of their food are)... it is a piece not quite on the collar itself but still very tender.  The monkey brains will please any fusion fan, it surely teased my palette with familiar crab salad mixed with sweet banana tempura.  I wanted to hate it so bad, but got quite the opposite effect.  \n\nAnd the sushi, my oh my.  The fish to rice ratio is ridunculous!  We loved the salmon, hamachi, super white tuna... and the lasagna roll is good if you like cream cheese.  How they make profit for serving great quality with an extensive AYCE menu for so cheap in a low key neighborhood eludes me.  I do hope they can keep up the exceptional value for your money!  I would totally franchise this spot.  Binge on good sushi with flip flops here or hide in one of the dark corners with an ugly mistress.  GOGOGO!  (P.S. I recommend not bringing the kids unless it was for lunch, or if they are capable of behaving like... college students out for sushi and sake.)\n\nI'M STILL DIGESTING...

I know it sounds shady but the interior is nicely decorated and like I mentioned previously the workers are totally awesome. \n- DESSERT IS INCLUDED IN THE AYCE!!!! Mochi and ice cream.

Order the shit it is really freakin good.  I would have given this place a 5 if it had not been for two things first I would have really liked it if they used less rice. 2nd they use way to much mayo based sauce and they put a lot of sauce in the dishes.  I don't know if they do this because people that eat sushi in the area want the sushi to be masked with sauce or it was just overkill.

It's not just about originality, it's just lacking of true Japanese service and spirits. Some even greet you back in Korean after you pay the bills.\n\nThey also want you to eat all the rice or a charge, but the rice portion is smaller than usual Korean, fake Japanese restaurants.

I ALWAYS go to the all you can eat sushi across the street from this particular restaurant, \"Sakana on Maryland\" however, i been yelping and reading the great reviews of the restaurant so i decided to go give it a try. I walked in and was greeted by Geo, which he walked us to the table and sat us down. My partner asked him about the 2 for 1 drink special that we seen on yelp, he said yes, I then asked him what type of drinks are part of the 2 for 1. He said sarcastically \"ALCOHOL\" then walked away.   At first, I thought it was a joke, then i quickly realized this Geo server was actually a rude individual. He walks back to our table and my partner says we will talk water \"which was never brought to us\".  I then asked him if we can get another server and he said sarcastically in a non caring manner \"YEA\" and walks away.  No one never came to us for about 3-4 minutes. I then walk up to the young lady to ask to speak to the manager which she tells me he wasn't present and he would be in the following day. I asked for a card and Geo said \" they are right over there\" In a \" non caring who cares\" type of way.  I grab the card took a quick picture of Geo and walked out.   I'm very upset because I really really wanted to try this place after reading all the great reviews but I can't support or spend any of my hard working dollars to a restaurant that has servers that are rude and disrespectful to guests.  I will NEVER go back into this restaurant and I will make sure to tell all my military friends and family to not ever step foot inside.  Geo needs more training on how to treat and speak to guests who are spending money in the establishment that he represents.

We came for lunch today and the restaurant had maybe 4 tables.  We sat for an hour and only 4 sushi items came out.  Being in the industry ourselves, we not only consider the food tasting good, but also the service.  We sat and continued to wait but nothing was coming to the table, there were 3 sushi chefs behind the bar.. What we ordered wasn't by any means more than what we could eat.  We couldn't wait anymore and just asked for the check.  Just ridiculous.  There are way better places to go than Sakana.   We will never return again.","date":"2015-02-26 22:17:14"}

The place isn't big, but not crammed in any way.  \n\nWe decided on the AYCE sushi option, as the menu is vast.  The only downside is that there isn't really any sashimi; or rather, the sashimi is not just simple raw cuts of fish, but instead sashimi dressed up in sauces, fruits or veggies.  However, there are definitely many different interesting rolls to try, and they were quite good.  I'm more of a nigiri and sashimi eater, but I definitely like rolls as well.\n\nAll in all, the fish here is just average, but the rolls were definitely creative, nicely presented, and tasty.  The cooked food was actually the best part of the menu surprisingly; the pork belly and tempura calamari was top-notch.  \n\nHave I been to a better AYCE sushi buffet at 24.95?  You bet.  But this one's not bad and will do for a pinch if you're in the area.","date":"2014-08-04 22:22:10"}

They did have fans sporadically placed throughout the small establishment.  I was seated soon after I walked into the restaurant and my drink order was immediately taken.  Shortly after, I was asked if I was ready to order. I replied that I was waiting for my friend.\n\n4 other people over the span of 30 minutes continued to ask if I was ready to order and each time I had to tell them I was waiting for my friend.  A bit of communication between staff would have been helpful here.\n\nWhen we did order, I ordered as a la carte.  The sushi was really good! Being from Hawaii, I consider myself a sushi snob and am particular about where in Las Vegas I go to eat sushi.  I would come back here again!  \n\nThe location is tucked away in the very end corner of the Target shopping center, behind the SAS shoe store.  To me, this makes it less accessible, which in turn means more empty tables!\n\nFinally, I would like to note that we were charged for the all you can eat instead of a la carte.  Not cool in my book.\n\nI am a fan, and will probably go back again.","date":"2014-07-21 20:14:56"}

Now, the fish to rice ratio is pretty awesome! \n\nOnce we entered the restaurant, a waiter took our order for appetizers. He then brought out a paper where we would fill it out and write how many pieces of nigiri, rolls, and other items. I swear that we ordered fewer nigiri than showed up, but they never gave me the paper back, \n\nThe service is pretty fast. Our sushi just kept coming and coming and coming.  At one point, one of the servers asked if we still wanted our yuzu yellowtail because we had so much food on the table. The servers kept coming by and asking us if everything was alright. They gave us our check once we ordered dessert, but then they took forever to take payment. It was like they stopped checking up on us after then. \n\nThey only allow 1 order per person of the specials which including the screaming o, salmon belly, avocado bomb, and mango salmon. I was bit sad that they only offered 1 order of salmon belly person. The shrimp came with huge fried shrimp on the side, and it only came with one shrimp per order. It was also only one order of ocean trout. \n\nOne of the things I didn't like was the different sauces that they put on top. I would rather just eat the fish by itself. \n\nNow, some of the information on yelp has changed. Out of green tea panna cotta, black sesame dessert, mochi, fried bananas, tempura ice cream, and mini honey toast, you could only pick one which bummed me out because that's my favorite part. I believe they allow unlimited ice cream or at least they didn't have a limit on it. The oysters are seasonal, so they didn't have any. They no longer serve soft shell crab.\n\nThey do offer 2 for 1 alcoholic. My friends ordered a yogurt soju. The soju was pretty good, but the drink size was pretty small. That's probably why it's such a deal!","date":"2015-01-31 21:08:26"}

Auto gratuity (for large party) plus tax... $30.\n\nYeah, the sushi is cheap...ER than other places but I'd rather pay more for better service and quality. My friends chose this place and after seeing all the wonderful pics on yelp, I was super excited to try it out. Boy, was I disappointed. None of the items we ordered looked like the pictures! Nigiri was aiiight. The slices of fish were pretty and long... but so thin, and so much rice! Rolls were decent. I didn't try too many so no real opinion on those.\n\nService was not impressive at all. We had a large party... 10 people. But we called and made a reservation the day before. They should have been prepared. It was dinner time and sorta busy but still only had 2 servers\/waiters. People that got there after us somehow managed to order and get their food before us. And our table was right in the middle of the place! They weren't ignoring us... just not very observant. Anywho, we were finally able to flag them down for orders but instead of taking orders normally, they handed us a sheet of paper with their menu items and had us mark which ones we wanted. I wasn't a fan of this but it made it easier for them. There were a couple things that I had to hand write out on the side because they didn't have it on the list.. NBD. The first couple appetizers came out but we still didn't have dipping or eating plates! We had to bug them to bring it out. The reason I was annoyed of the service was because they were hard to get a hold of. Each time they brought a new item out, they'd hand it to us (literally... hand the plate to us, instead of placing it on the table), and have us figure out the organizing. There was a handful of times where we had empty plates to be cleared but they just walked away. \n\nAlso.... I'm not normally a huge germaphobe but there were fruit flies all over! We kept waving our hands around the entire time to shoo them away. They were even in the restroom.\n\nI will most likely not ever come back here again.","date":"2014-05-04 19:06:33"}

This meant I was able to cram a few extra orders of nigiri in as I wasn't stuffed with rice.\n\nThe Batman Burrito was our favorite non-nigiri item, and I think we ended up ordering 3 orders when all was said and done.  I tried a few other dishes from the kitchen which were ok, and the rolls weren't bad either, but that's not my thing.\n\nThe service was a strange mix.  They were super attentive and kept coming over to us to ask if we wanted anything else.  Unfortunately, they kept forgetting 1 item off each order, so we kept having to re-order.

The staff were all very pleasant and accommodating, especially for how many people we had and how much we ordered! \n\nThe fish to rice ratio was perfect!! I could wrap the fish back around the rice, which is so much more than can be said about most sushi places, much less AYCE. I also really appreciated that they actually made the effort to bring the nigiri out quickly enough that the fish would still be relatively cold, but the rice still warm! Unfortunately, the sushi rice didn't really hold up too well, but I guess I ain't complaining if I didn't want to eat that much rice anyway.\n\nMy favorite rolls were the Screaming O, Something Wrong, and Burning Your Ass (LOL.). There were some rolls we ordered I really wanted to try (like all the other spicy rolls) but our group was weaksawce and ordered way too much of a few of the same things so we had to cancel a bunch of orders in the end.

I don't know about other people, but me and my friends zero in on nigiri when we go to an AYCE sushi place.  Not to say the rolls aren't good, but they are so varied and contain so many ingredients, it's hard to tell what's what and sometimes it's difficult to distinguish between rolls in terms of taste.\n\nAnyway, the rolls have funny names and again, they are good.  But I'm partial to nigiri.  The variations of albacore and yellowtail are my personal favorites, but they have your basic tunas and salmons as well, along with more exotic stuff like salmon eggs, oyster, and the like.\n\nEvery now and then you'll get a piece of fish that seems like it was recently frozen (it probably was), but still very good.  Fish like salmon and seared stuff is usually very buttery.\n\nI did like how they had the written order system before, but now they take your order for everything.

My sister HIGHLY recommended this place to me. I think our server \"Silvia\" probably wasn't having the best day. She was serving us alright. She wasn't amazing, but she wasn't horrible. We were 5 adults and 2 babies. The 5 adults did the AYCE. \n\nWe got through lunch and it was time for dessert! My mom ordered 2 tempura ice cream, 1 honey toast, 1 fried banana, and 1 panna cotta. We received the panna cotta super quick. I guess they have it ready and refrigerated. My mom loved it and asked a different server for another one, which she got right away. When the rest of the desserts arrived there was only 1 of each. I got \"Silvia's\" attention to notify her that we were short 1 tempura ice cream. Her response verbatim \"You only get 1 dessert person and you already got your 5\". We were a bit confused and then she mentioned my mom ordered another panna cotta. Which is completely fine, but I was curious how she decided to edit the \"original\" order. We ordered the second panna cotta AFTER we ordered the 2 tempura ice creams. I waited to pay the check and wanted to speak to her about her delivery. I understand they have policies, but didn't appreciate the way she spoke to me. She took a while to come back around, so I walked the bill up to the cashier. I then informed the cashier of the situation. That she should of informed us kindly that it's 1 dessert per person and that she would be happy to give us another panna cotta for an additional charge OR if we wanted to swap it for another dessert. From the corner of my eye I saw her standing to the left of me. I turned to her to speak to her and then she tells me with the attitude that \"your mother only ordered 1 tempura ice cream\". All of a sudden her excuse changed? She even did the neck snap when she spoke to me. I turned to the cashier and said \"did you see that\"? He then apologized to me and said he'll speak to her.

We decided to check it out because it was the least expensive AYCE sushi dinner that we found in Yelp at $22.95 (others even surpassed $25).\n\nThe rolls were not loaded with rice and the fish slices were generous...  Just what the doctor ordered!  The menu has a lot of selections and the Towering Sashimi Poki was the item we enjoyed the most.  It was among the rolls that you can order only once but since there were 4 of us, we maxed this one out.  The Sashimi Roll was delectable, too.  However, I thought it would have been more elegant if it did not have imitation crab in it.\n\nGood food tastes even better with good service.  Our server (Sun) was very attentive and friendly plus she wore a smile everytime.  Morever, the sushi chefs deserved a pat on the back for their plating ideas.  They surely made the food look so appetizing.\n\nIt would have been a more satisfying experience if they included sashimi on the menu.

Especially with the high reviews for Sakana, we decided to give them a try one night. We came with our kids at about 8pm, and it was a bit crowded, but not too bad.  i think we waited for about 15 minutes on a Tuesday night. \n\nI do have to say that the service is extremely fast.  The food came out minutes after we ordered it!  The taste was great, and the server was nice, but also hurried (as expected and appreciated).  It is too bad that the top menu items are only \"1 time at dinner\" such as the Uni.  However, it is understood to keep that policy so that the price remains reasonable and people don't take advantage.\n\nThe one thing about their policies that i didn't like is the \"Yelp\" forcing.  Like many other Japanese places, they offer you a free drink with Yelp.  However, the difference is that instead of just checking in (and writing a review later), they force you to write a review before the free drink.  That is a bit weird that they expect you to review before eating, and have to write it on your phone.  \n\nI am updating my review now so that I can give a true feedback to the restaurant.  Sakana is a great option for ayce in Vegas, but just know it is off the strip.  I plan on returning one day.\n\nFunny thing is that I actually went to Sakana about a year ago with some co-workers here in Vegas.  However, when we arrived, they lost their liquor license, so we decided to go eat somewhere else.  I am glad that I returned and that their liquor license is back.","date":"2016-08-24 03:53:30"}

Shawn isnt kidding at all when he mentions the fish to rice ratio, they don't crop the slice to the rice, instead they leave a giant slice that's long enough to wrap around the rice which is quite a noticeable change as compared to other spots. \n\nAnother thing that impressed me what the Goyemon-like policy on no limitations to how many desserts you can get.\n\nThe plum ice cream was by far some of the best ice cream I've had in a sushi joint.\n\nSo why a missing star? Well of the things we ordered were sauce heavy, they really sauced up some of the dishes. A few of the appetizers lacked an explanation on the menu but instead said something long the lines of 'hey you! order me i am friggin amazing!' and when it comes it's nothing more than krab (that fake crab that's made from fish paste) in a deep fried shell drizzled with sauce. Not to say it wasnt good, well to me it wasnt that's just due to my hatred of krab with a K, but had i known i would have not ordered it and went for more nigiri. \n\ndefinitely on my radar now as an all you can eat sushi joint that has great value for what you get but i'll be steering clear of the sauced items. \n\n\nYelp 100 - 045 of 100","date":"2013-09-24 18:41:12"}

It is hidden inside a little shopping complex in the corner and if you don't pay attention, you probably wouldn't even notice it! It is an AYCE or pay by the plate but if you eat enough, it is worth it to do the AYCE.\n\nMy favorite nigiri was the Yuzu yellowtail nigiri and it was perfection! I liked it because the nigiri fish were nice and cold, fresh and just the perfect size on top of the rice. I liked the rice too because it wasn't too sticky like regular sushi rice but it was a bit fluffy and the piece of rice was about an inch long- perfect so you don't get full off of rice!\n\nYou can order rolls as well but be aware that if you don't finish it, you'll have to pay for it so order slow. The rolls are hearty sized rolls and they don't have fillers like cream cheese. It is heavy on rice so watch out for that.\n\nI loved that for the AYCE, you can order any appetizer, rolls or nigiri on the menu. They did have ones specific for dinner only or ones that was a one time order, so I suggest trying that because it is worth it!\n\nFor appetizer, they have one called \"the shit\"- basically 2 small egg roll like roll that is mixed with a warm crab mixture and mayo with a spicy mayo and eel sauce and their \"pang\" is a house special! The \"pang\" is basically 2 small pieces of garlic toast with a creamy crab mixture topped with what tastes kinda like melted cheese. We got 4 orders of pang!!! Try the baked mussels as well- not too much mayo as a filler but just enough. \n\nThe ice cream is AYCE but their speciality dessert is only one per person.

Upon walking in, there was a good vibe I didn't expect.  The restaurant was playing popular upbeat music , and had perfect lighting for the ambiance. They sat us in a booth which was very spacious. The decor was pleasing and they had little character seat cushions which I thought looked cool. \n\nThey had plenty of choices on their AYCE menu.  $20.95 for lunch and $25.95 for dinner. Kids price is $14.95. The proportion of fish on the nigiris were generous. The food tasted good as well. Don't order the shumai, they were tiny and burnt. \n\nService was ok. Not amazing, but not bad either. I didn't get the server's name.  I wasn't offered a refill the whole time I was there. The bussers and food runners seem to be on point though! I kept having to look for my server to order. In the end I still enjoyed my first visit there.","date":"2017-06-24 05:30:36"}

I like that not everything is a roll or drowned in sauce.\n\nDefinitely try the Scallop Nigiri, no mayo, the amaebi with the head fried, the toro steak if they have it, and the Sakana Poki.  The sashimi salad is good (the shrimp tempura is sometimes a little stale but otherwise great dish).  My younger son loves the short ribs, he had three bowls.

As we said this out loud, the gentleman that was standing next to me looked liked he was the manager and I guess he overheard our conversation and asked what was wrong. We told him what was going on, he then proceeded to take our order since that guy waiter failed to take the first time. No apology from the guy waiter from walking away from us and didn't bother to acknowledge us after this incident. He looked overwhelmed with maybe the amount of tables he had to serve but to leave us hanging and not finish what we wanted to order was just rude. On my second trip with a friend, he was our waiter again. This time he was a little bit better till the last round. My friend had asked for one more order and what happens we never got my friends last order. Why write something down on your paper to place an order but don't bother to even send out the request. He didn't even bother to check if we got it or not. After he forgot to place the last order, he then went straight ahead to ask us if we were ready for dessert?!?

If you're looking for a central location with good service and fresh fish, this is the place to go. \n\nThey have a great variety of appetizers (mussels, tempura, bacon wrapped scallops, edamame, miso soup, calamari, seaweed salad, pork belly, etc) and lots of rolls for those who liked savory, sweet, baked, fresh, and spicy! You'll find favorites such as one minute man, wet dream, and snow in Vegas (which I thought were only at Yama, but it looks like they're here also!) \n\nHere's my favorite favorite part about Sakana. AND I'm sure it's other nigiri lovers' favorite also. THE FISH TO RICE RATIO = BEAUTIFUL. Gorgeous amount of fresh fish on top of a small bed of rice. THATS the best. \n\nLike dessert?

I could never have kept that sort of positive attitude if I was working late at night, so I give mad props to them for that. \n\nFood: the fish was fresh, hand rolls were awesome, portions were good; nigiri's rice to fish ratio was perfect (I don't like too much rice), and the mochi for dessert was a bonus. \n\nComparisons: I've only been to one other AYCE sushi place in Vegas, which was Yama sushi, and which I felt sucked in comparison. The only type of AYCE place I preferred to this one is one I went to in NJ, which had all the rolls, sashimi, nigiri, seaweed salad, and other stuff out in a buffet, so you could pick and choose how much you wanted of each thing instead of having to order a half roll or whole roll like these AYCE sushi places where its made after ordering.","date":"2014-12-14 18:13:22"}

This location solicits for reviews and it is obviously affecting their rating system. They have fliers on each table offering a free drink if you show them a completed and posted Yelp review! This is wrong! That said, this was a HUGE disappointment! \n\nThe bad (besides the HUGE offense already mentioned): \nThe cuts of sushi are thick but poorly sliced. The Eel was burned and the BBQ sauce was WAY too sweet! Wasabi is a paste (which is ok since real wasabi is hard to come by) but this was so heavy in horse radish that it was terrible! The California rolls have a mushy mayonnaise paste like filling. I understand some sushi places do this and while I don't like it generally, this was inedible.  \n\nThe reason for two stars (instead of 1): \nOur service wasn't terrible. While she did forget our sake, but the staff was generally friendly and prompt. They do have some interesting specials. There is an all-you-can-eat option (both lunch and dinner) which is well executed and does leave dollars in you wallet. So that's a bonus. And the 2 for 1 drinks is a nice touch. While the sushi is mediocre, the all-you-can-eat and drinks specials are nice.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Sakana does NOT deserve the 5 star reviews it continually gets. It solicits for these reviews and requires a patron to show the POSTED review to get a free drink. (Naturally, this will encourage a guest to give a higher review since it must be shown while dining) This is appalling! Even if the specials were enough to entice me back, their unethical Yelp abuse forces me to boycott this location until it is remedied.","date":"2016-10-23 06:51:12"}

The food was definitely not 4.5 stars and the service was so incompetent!!\n\nI came here with 5 other friends around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately in the corner of the restaurant. 5 of us did the AYCE and 1 person ordered a la carte, which was accommodating of them. We waited for what seemed like forever for our server to come by to order. We had to physically go get someone to come take our order, but then when he did come, he just gave us a checklist sheet. Why did you not just give that to us when you sat us down?? So by the time we finished checking off our orders, we flagged someone ELSE down to take our order sheet.\n\nThen someone else came by to take our appetizer order. We ordered the shishito peppers, the poke tower, the SHIT (because they said its a must try), agedashi tofu, baked mussels, and oysters. They ran out of salmon kama, but they had hamachi kama, which was fine. But only HALF of our orders showed up....little did we know that this would be the pattern for the night. The oysters were lukewarm when they got to us andm did not taste very fresh because of that. The poke tower was not bad. The SHIT was spicy crab wrapped in seaweed (not nori) and tempura fried served with spicy mayo - it was salty and not spectacular. The baked mussels were probably the only appetizer we liked.\n\nWhile waiting for our sushi to come, the servers kept bringing us the wrong order or stuff we didnt order. This must have happened at least 3 times. Seriously?  What the heck...\n\nAfter what seemed like forever, we finally started getting our sushi, but they were horrible with the coordination! We'd get a plate with 6 nigiri, and then wait another 5 minutes for more food to come. It was like this ALL night. The salmon nigiri was basic, but the cut of tuna left it dry and not palatable at all. I had the Chanel roll, which was ok if they didnt drench it in sauce. We ordered mackerel by accident, but since it was AYCE, we felt bad for sending it back. So we ate it out of AYCE courtesy, but the mackerel was obviously not good. They drenched it in their house sauce and a ton of lemons. You know fish is not fresh when they have to cover their nigiri in sauces. Finally, at the 1 hour mark, all our food came at once. At this point, we were not in the mood to eat anymore! The 6 orders of white tuna nigiri we ordered finally came at the end, but they screwed it up and gave us their 'super tuna', which is basically white tuna in their house sauce. We thought, maybe we ordered the wrong thing again...so we flagged someone down and order just 1 order of white tuna. And when it came, it was their 'super tuna' again! We stared at the plate when it came and just thought, \"Are you kidding me??\" At that point, we were just tired of arguing with the staff. We ate it. The fish might have been good if they didnt drench it in sauce...\n\nFinally, we ask for the check, and they were nice enough to split for us. But then when we got our cards back, the one friend who didn't do AYCE was charged twice by mistake, but they caught it, voided it, and informed us about it. But upon closer inspection, she had charged her the AYCE price, when her check only came out to be $9 since half her orders never even came out!!! This place only gets 2 stars instead of 1 because the woman who messed up the checks was so sweet about it and they were attentive about refilling our water - obviously I'm being generous. To add insult to injury, because we were a larger party, they added the 18% gratuity automatically to our checks, which I never mind, except service was...UGH....never again.","date":"2014-11-23 18:11:10"}

If it wasn't for the attitude from some of the waiters and weird furniture arrangement, I would have given Sakana 5 stars instead of 4.\n\nNow, let's talk about price and get it out of the way. The price is very similar to most AYCE sushi joints, $20.95 for lunch and $24.95 for dinner. \n\nWhat about the food? Luv it!!!! Their rice to fish ratio is awesome and the best I've seen so far. The fish was fresh and the portion is plentiful. I highly suggest you try the Salmon Kama, it's the bomb.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, what I don't like about this place is their service and furniture layout. Some of the staff are nice, but most of them barely cracked a smile (including the owner lady) and they gave the \"order one time, eat fast and get out\" kinda look. In term of furniture, their setup created a bottleneck and make wait time extra long. In their not so big dinning area, they have a long table that can seat probably 12 - 14 people in the middle of the dinning room and I rarely see this table being occupied. They also have a lot of 4-people tables which they don't like to seat party of two, therefore it ended up with a whole bunch of 2 party groups waiting to be seated while there are empty tables. I hope my description makes sense :-)\n\nOverall, I still like Sakana and most likely will go for lunch since it's less busy and don't have to wait long for a table.","date":"2015-01-28 19:22:02"}

There was like a 20 to 30 minute wait when we first got there. It wasn't too bad. The dining area is a decent size. Service was quick and attentive. For the buffet they give you the menu and you can order anything off either side of it. The only thing that's an additional charge is drinks. They make every order fresh when you order. All the sushi was fresh and delicious. Oh and get the oysters, they were so so good. I wish i had seen that on the menu earlier because i would have ordered more. I tried to order the ones with less rice because I didn't want to get too full. For the price the buffet is definitely a better choice. It's so worth it. You must try. Oh and for dessert get the tempura ice cream.","date":"2016-09-16 23:29:33"}

And both times I had something on the menu called \"the sh*t\" and it was absolutely FANTASTIC it is definitely a must have! The first time I dined here I did the all you can eat and while it was pricey, the fish is fresh and the rolls are tasty. The second time I did a la carte and only had two rolls but felt just as full as the all you can eat. The rolls here are somewhat unique (somewhat the same as Yama sushi across the street which I highly recommend) my main problem is it is very VERY hard to avoid fried rolls, or rolls with fried ingredients here. Which if you are gluten free, this restaurant would be impossible for you to eat at, which is uncommon for sushi places.\n\nBesides the overabundance of everything fried, the service here is awful! When you walk in you often stand at the podium with a sheet of paper with names on it and no instructions for an indiscriminate amount of time. On my second visit I just wanted to sit at the bar and I asked if I still had to sign the sheet and the server wouldn't give me a clear answer. Turns out the answer is no. And with all you can eat, the slow service is definitely a hindrance! Even when I did the a la carte we were constantly trying to flag down our server because we needed something.\n\nOverall this place is okay, but if you're looking for an all you can eat sushi experience I recommend somewhere else such as Yama sushi or sushi hero.","date":"2018-03-11 13:25:19"}

It is a cute little place with little knick knacks placed around the restaurant so everywhere you looked there was something to find. Service was good, drinks were never empty. Sushi came out quickly, which I can't complain about. Good was very tasty, like everyone else has mentioned the rice to fish ratio 1:1. One thing I do notice about good sushi is that the rice is compacted enough where it it stays together from the pick up to the dipping of soy, be soft enough when it hits your mouth the rice will fall apart on its own without the first chew. I know it sounds weird but it's true. Lastly, just to mention the black sesame panna cotta desert was perfect, not too sweet but still tastes the roasted seeds was excellent. The boyfriend says it tasted like a \"rubber tire\" but he does not like the Asian deserts much so there you go.","date":"2015-09-21 06:00:05"}

Guys, trust me when I say that the extra $5pp is totally worth it as the items from the dinner portion were some of my favorites.  \n\nThe restaurant was located fairly close to the strip, approximately 10 minutes or so by car.  We arrived soon after the restaurant open and it was fairly empty when we sat down, which worked in our favor as the our server was very attentive, and we were able to place orders at a rapid speed.  The place filled up by the time we left, and the servers were not as readily available toward the end.  Overall, for an AYCE place, the service was good and prompt, there were a handful of busboys nearby that made sure your water glasses are always filled.  The orders also came extremely fast after they were place.\n\nNow, on to the main event, the actual food here.  We tried quite a number of dishes, four appetizers, two yakitori, twelve different kinds of nigiri, two rolls and two desserts.  I guess you can say we got our money's worth!  Most of the dishes we tried were quite good, particularly the rice to fish ratio for the nigiri, which can be problematic at an all you can eat place.  My favorite pieces were the salmon belly, oyster, uni and mackerel, not surprisingly, three of those were dinner only items and you can only order once.  I can eat a whole meal of just salmon belly.  \n\nI regret not noticing the \"no rice\" portion of the menu, which was all the way at the end of the back page, until nearly the end of the meal.  I would've tried all of the items on that portion had I found it in the beginning of the meal.  I really liked the Towering Sashimi Poki, the fish tasted fresh and well seasoned.  My least favorite was the deep fried roll, although that was my own fault, as I should've known it would be super heavy given the fact that it was \"deep fried\".  I think the main issue with that dish and most of the appetizers is that they are sooooo heavily drenched in sauce, particularly the creamy aioli prominently featured in nearly all of the none nigiri dishes.  PRO TIP: when placing the order, ask for light sauce, or simply sauce on the side.\n\nLast, but not least, both desserts we ordered were good, but the highlight was the affogato.  It was surprising to find good coffee at a Japanese restaurant, and vanilla ice cream is always a good addition to coffee.  \n\nOverall, I thought it was a great meal for the amount that we paid, i.e. $26pp.  I would definitely come back again, and would probably just stick to the nigiri portion of the menu.","date":"2017-12-14 23:13:18"}

Today I brought my entire family and talked so highly about Sakana prior to arrival, only to be disappointed. \n\nTook us about 15 minutes to get our waters and we were the first guests there. I asked if they could do no rice rolls and our server told us multiple times that they could then another server came up to us and proceeded to say that it was not possible and they would charge us ON TOP OF THE AYCE PRICE! \nDetermined to not let it ruin my experience I passed it off as a misunderstanding and waited and waited and waited for our rolls. It is currently 12:54 and I've been here since 11:30 and I'm still waiting for rolls I ordered over an hour ago. \n\nI ordered a scoop of green tea ice cream a la carte and they came out with the most pathetic excuse of a scoop of ice cream. Their \"scoop\" bad basically 2 spoon scoop, something a grown adult can basically finish in 2-3 bites. When I brought it up without server she gave us attitude me proceeded to respond \"well that's our scoop\". For the price that I'm paying ($2.50) I'd at least expect a decent scoop of ice cream. \n\nI've always loved Sakana and was originally going to give this 3 stars because maybe I came at a wrong time, but my experience only got worse the longer I stayed. Extremely disappointed and I regret ever recommending this place to so many people. I would hate for them to have the same disappointing experience. Will definitely not be returning.","date":"2015-06-06 20:01:36"}

The rolls do contain a lot of rice, so be careful ordering too much when you go with the all you can eat option (AYCE). The food keeps coming and the staff is always checking on you to see if you will order more. They have plenty of options and you can order from the entire menu. Watch out for some of the spicy options as they can be very spicy. I typically just get regular rolls and add jalapeño. Some of my favorites are the yuzu yellowtail, the baked mussels, and the rainbow add jalapeños. But you really may as well try everything else on the menu as we havent found one thing we don't like aside from the sweet yum yum sauce. Wait times can be long during peak dinner hours. Can't say enough about the staff though, especially the hostess. After the second time there, she recognized us and welcomed us back. Great customer service. Music can be a little loud so if you don't like loud music, this is not the place for you.

The only downside is that we felt rushed, they wanted as many people in and out asap. After our second order the question if we wanted dessert already popped. The music was loud and fast, not in place for a restaurant like this. \n\nHowever, I rate restaurants mostly on their food and food experience and that my people, was astonishing. We went 2 nights in a row, just so we could try a lot of the menu. The fish was fresh, the rolls had great flavour balance and everything melted on our tongues. We had some Pork belly, tuna and some delightful mixed rolls. The vegas roll, japanese lasagna and 49'ers roll had us on the floor dying out of sheer bliss. \n\nOn top of that, during weekdays you don't have to wait that long and the price is low in comparison to the food!

Been here twice, once when they first changed owners and they didn't have a proper sign outside and the decor inside was dark, and it was probably the same tables and decor as the previous owners restaurant (not sure if it was also a Sushi joint) but this second time that I went, we called ahead for group of 7 and they even had a RESERVED sign on our table, so I thought that was nice. They were ready and prepared for our group. I walked in surprised to see they had a proper sign on the outside of the restaurant, so already a plus they got to fixing that. I was even more surprised to walk in and see the entire decor and get up of the place had changed into a wooden modern look. I love it!! and they have pillow cushions for the seats since everything is wood. \n\nSakana did not disappoint!! In our group of 7, it was 5 people's first time!! All my friends were raving about the rice to fish ratio, as all of us that were eating are big Nigiri fans, so our AYCE dinner mostly comprised of that; Salmon, Super White, Spicy Tuna, Unagi, etc... we ordered everything pretty much. Everything was super fresh... if you're a avid sushi eater, you can tell the difference between fresh sushi and aight sushi... and Sakana is definitely up there with the best of them, if not the best. Oooo and the Unagi, they torch it!!! so good!!! \n\nThe rolls are really good as well, and of course, more fish than rice as well. Sakana offers lunch AYCE at $20.99 and dinner at $24.99 so not only is the fish to rice ratio outta this world... but this is actual affordable AYCE, and the difference in food choices between lunch and dinner is minute.... there is one item that I had that is a dinner item only: SEAFOOD SALAD... and if you straight up just want Sashimi, you have to get this!!! it's literally just an assortment of fish and shredded radish and sauce... it's so good and definitely an item you wanna get if you like it RAW :) that Seafood salad is also 1 order per person\n\nTheir appetizer items are also very good, they are small portion, but i like that coz it leaves more room in the belly to try everything on the menu lol :) but our group fav appetizer of the night was definitely the \"dragon ball\" - a portabella  mushroom stuffed with crabmeat, cream cheese, green onions, tempera covered and fried, drizzled with yum yum sauce on top!!! it's a must-try, my other fav item is \"the shit\" i believed its cooked salmon stuffed and fried in seaweed wrap with other items in it with this sweet spicy sauce... probably more to it, but it's another menu must-try. they also have fresh oysters, 1order per person, along with other special items that are 1order per person but they are worth it!\n\nokay now desserts!!! they have unlimited amounts of orders for plum, red bean, green tea ice creams. plum is good but its a little pink medicine tasting for my taste buds, like a little like pepto bismol lol then they have \"choice 1 item\" desserts from choices of mini honey toast, fried bananas, some black bean pudding kinda thing called \"black manger\", and some fruit dish. The Mini Honey Toast and Fried Banana come with one scoop of vanilla ice cream as well... and the mini honey toast also has the stuffed cream inside!!! and even the presentation of the Fried Banana was impressive. \n\nMost definitely Sakana is a sushi lover's dream! especially if you a sashimi\/nigiri lover... so for our final bill with gratuity & tax included, I paid $32, splitting the bill with all 7 of us. Note: they can split the bill any way you like, no restrictions which is nice for big groups. Decor of the place is nice and light, and they no longer are playing Korean Music Vids, but had food network channel playing which was more appropriate to me verses the korean pop haha bathroom is also well kept and clean. \n\nSakana for me sets the bar for quality sushi and a local's favorite go to place for AYCE. Best deal in Vegas, for high quality sushi!!! Can't go wrong, decor is nice and well lit, food is above phenomenal, good for accommodating big groups and splitting bills, bathroom is clean, service is good... can't go wrong here... 5 stars all the way!","date":"2014-12-30 05:07:16"}

This was *not* the AYCE sushi I intended to visit yesterday - in fact, we drove all the way to Jjanga, only to find it closed all afternoon for a private party. Well, I had recalled that someone on yelp had mentioned in their review of Jjanga that they considered a different place to be better, so I pulled out my phone in the parking lot, found that review again, googled the place it mentioned (clearly, Sakana), then drove all the way back to totally the other side of town, way less confident because I hadn't looked at a menu or anything. \n\nWell, I obviously can't say which is actually better, since Jjanga was closed so we never went there, but Sakana is, as of right now, my all-time sushi place (in terms of awesome for value ratio). \n\nFood was just as good as everyone here has been saying: I'm super-picky about nigiri, and after trying a couple of them to check, I pretty much just went down the nigiri menu and ordered everything. Then got a couple extra orders of the salmon. They don't use too much rice, which is indeed excellent in general, but especially in an AYCE place. \n\nWe tried a few of their more fusiony rolls, too, and while they were also very good, my one complaint is that out of the dozens of rolls on the menu, most of them are really pretty much just variations on only a couple basic concepts. But that shouldn't matter too much, because you can get good fusiony rolls at AYCE places all over the place, but good nigiri at far fewer of them. (That said, I did also try one of their crazy hand rolls, the one that used rice paper, and it was excellent, and much more unique. I wish I'd had the stomach capacity to try a couple more of their hand rolls, but I'd already stuffed myself with nigiri. Next time!)\n\nOur experience service-wise could not have been any less like a lot of the reviews here: it was phenomenal. It's rare to get really good service at an AYCE place, but these guys went above and beyond. Granted, we did show up for lunch right when they opened, but even once it started getting busy, they still gave us everything we requested, correctly, within a couple minutes of asking for it. And whoever gave us our bill must have been training as an actual ninja, because they dropped off our check, I stuck a credit card on it, and we had our check processed and dropped back off literally like 30 seconds later. \n\nI had no complaints about the seats, either. Yes, they looked... different, but I didn't find them particularly any more uncomfortable than normal chairs.\n\nedit: I don't really have anything new to say about it, but we were back last weekend (October 2016), and it was still just as quality as I remembered. Tried a couple of their other fancy hand rolls: all great. Get here right when they open if you don't want a wait, though - we were there right when it opened on a Sunday, and by the time we left, the wait was out the door.","date":"2015-03-02 04:32:54"}

All delicious.\n\nThis place still apparently has some of the absolute best Surf Clam. They use nice portions for all the seafood.\n\nThe Salmon Skin Roll is excellent, just saying.\n\nFull Moon Roll is still one of the best here. The Japanese Lasagna was good, not amazing.\n\nTowering Sashimi Poki is still really great, and only comparable to Sushi Doh's \"Nacho Daddy\".\n\nSeafood Salad is decent. I actually preferred the cucumber out of it. The Bulgogi Nacho is tasty, and different all around.\n\nGreen Tea Panna Cotta for dessert, a nice touch.\n\nI would definitely come here a 3rd time. I'd also recommend giving this place a try if you haven't.\n\nService is still very good too! :)","date":"2015-03-28 05:16:06"}

We are super excited to have found this place and we will be back very soon!","date":"2015-08-17 00:18:27"}

They have all you can eat lunch until 3p for like $21 and you can order everything off the menu.  Since it was 2:30p already and we were not that hungry, we opted to order al-la-carte.  The menu looks good though.  It has all kinds of skewers but mostly rolls.  We ordered the 'Snow in Vegas', 'Lemon Salmon', 'Chef #1' and they were all good.  We also had the monkey brain which is tempura banana with spicy crab (interesting).  The server was very attentive.  Since I have my child with me, the only drawback is that most of the rolls are spicy and there were many 'bad' words on the menu.  Other than that, I would definitely go back especially when I am hungry for Japanese rolls.","date":"2016-11-24 17:17:10"}

A friend recommended Sakana so we decided to try it out.\n\nThe first likeable thing is that we were quickly given a table eventhough it's a Friday night. I also liked that there's enough space between tables so my husband and I can actually talk and enjoy the food without being unintentionally bothered by other customers' conversations. Staff are courteous and prompt, too.\n\nWe liked the baked green mussels, shrimp tempura, garlic tuna, Bam-Bam (and I can't rember the other one). The seafood salad and hamachi kama are alright but would not be on top of mind. Too bad those two are our usual cravings. Other than that, the place is good.\n\n#","date":"2016-10-24 03:51:43"}

We use to be regulars at yama sushi, but this place blows every other sushi place out of the water. The quality of fish they use was delicious and fresh. The service both times was great even though they were busy. The only downside is it is a small place, so at times it can get a little congested, but overall excellent food and wonderful service.","date":"2016-11-22 06:33:37"}

We had a party of four so we waited around 20-30 mins so It wasn't bad. We ordered a lot of Nigiri, our favorites are super white tuna and seared lemon salmon, they are tendered and sweet. Overall, our experience was great with an exception that we found a thread of hair in the wasabi.","date":"2018-01-20 05:37:58"}

Prices are decent, and they offer an AYCE (all you can eat) sush for about 25 bucks.  The Sushi Chefs were awesome and interacted with us.  The non sushi menu was sufficient for the Mrs (she doesnt like sushi).  The nachos are damn tasty.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!","date":"2014-04-17 18:30:27"}

This is a charming Sushi restaurant with decent sushi, you have options for all you can eat if you are extra hungry.  The nigiri is fresh, cut nicely and portioned welk.  We came here for lunch not expecting an all you can eat place but decided to try anyways and looking at the pricing AYCE appears to be the better deal.  Here they have soda by the can not fountain.  I would recommend this place!","date":"2016-12-09 21:27:07"}

Just stopped by this place and I'd like to start by saying the service is great.. The servers were very attentive and polite.. I got \" The Shit\" and veggie Tempura to start. Both were good the \"The Shit\" is a must just like the menu says.. Also got the lemon salmon roll and some super white tuna on the side. The lemon roll was good just like at home for me. The super white was freaking good also got the Pork Belly which was amazing!!! And beer is 2 for 1.. Will definitely be stopping by while I'm in Vegas!!","date":"2016-01-28 02:16:25"}
