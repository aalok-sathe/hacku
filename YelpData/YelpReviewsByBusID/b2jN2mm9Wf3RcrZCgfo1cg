The \"Man O'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. \nThe only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  \nNonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! \nThe reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! \nThe servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! \nAfter another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. \nThis is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. \nThe toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.","date":"2015-01-18 14:04:18"}

They also have great cocktails made with local spirits (during the holidays I recommend the apple cider + spiced rum)!

It was beyond all our expectations!! I had the Rusalka Vanilla Stout & Shoreway Shandy. The stout was so smooth with hints of Madagascar vanilla bean. One of the best I have had. The Shoreway Shandy was so quenching with an outstanding taste of lemon.  I absolutely LOVED their special touch of three raspberries added as a floater. Fantastic idea! We ended up bringing a growler home!! My husband had the High Tide Hefeweizen that was outstanding, amongst other beers they had on tap. We also tried a three flight of their rum, the vanilla maple rum, spiced rum and Christmas spiced. We ended up bringing home a bottle of the vanilla maple rum made with Madagascan vanilla beans and pure Northern Ohio maple syrup. As far as food, I had the avocado chicken salad sandwich and my husband had the beef sliders. Both were served with pasta salad and everything was outstanding! Service was awesome! The kind of service no one sees anymore, which was very refreshing! Francesca is the BEST!!!! You can tell she loves her job and people! There was not one thing we didn't like about this place!

Walking in on a Friday night, it was not busy at all. I ordered a beer that was mixed with rum, one of their \"rum beers\" which sounded exciting but unfortunately, it was nothing special tasting. Nor was the pretzel and beer cheese, just one of those \"I'll eat it because I'm hungry and it's front of my face.\" I see so much potential here though! Like I said, it's in a hot spot and it's really nice inside. A big plus for me was the fact that they had games. It's very rare to find that at a bar in a city and so I ended up spending three hours here playing games! So I guess it could be a good thing it wasn't obnoxiously loud.

We shared some laughs over 80's music, cartoons and Star Wars. She even showed us her Ninja Turtle Lunch box.  Awesome girl!

Runner up would be the Hopped. It had a different but interesting taste. Needless to say, we left with a bottle of Christmas Spirit.  I had a little Intel that they were between Brewers and that the previous brewer wasn't so hot so we stuck to he run on this trip.

A little more relaxed and mellow Portside is a cool bar that brews its own beer and rum.  The bar has lots of brick and wood which gives the place a welcoming feel and you would think the bar has been here for a long time.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday afternoons you can do a tour and it is an interesting and different great time.  I went on Sunday and had Tess as a tour guide, and she is wonderful, enthusiastic and knowledgeable.   The tour will take you into two different rooms where the beer is brewed and the rum is distilled.  Tess carefully explained the process for both and made the whole thing fun.  \n\nAfter the tour you get to sample one of the rums and one of the beers.  I tried the Chocolate Porter and the Maple Vanilla Rum.  The Porter was dark and slightly bitter with a smooth mouth feel and coffee and chocolate notes.  It is a full bodied beer that is very satisfying.  The rum is mellow with a hint of vanilla and a subtle maple aftertaste.\n\nPortside is a great place to get some craft brewed beers or some great rums.  If you are interested the tour is a nice activity and you can learn some new things.","date":"2016-03-14 01:02:14"}

People that visit a brewery tap room and then bitch about the \"limited menu\" or make comments like \"I'll be back when they've got a full menu\" have no freakin' idea what the hell a brewery tap room is. Most tap rooms don't serve food of any kind, so Portside's already a step ahead. Allow me to educate - It's about the beer. Period. Want food? Go to a restaurant.\n\nThe small tasting room\/taphouse for Portside Brewery & Distillery - or Distillery\/Brewery if you're more a spirits fan - was awhile in the making. They (re)opened their doors in mid-January 2015 with an expanded, more beer-centric space and the crowds have been quite appreciative. As I said in my earlier rant, a brewery tap room is a showcase of their beer. This is where Portside doesn't disappoint.\n\nWe paid them a visit on a Saturday afternoon sometime around 2 and it was pretty chill. A couple folks sitting at the bar. I'm sure the shitty Cleveland weather had something to do with it. Whatever the case, there are a few large tables, a bar that seats around 10 and a couple of smaller tables. It's a small spot and I'm sure it gets crowded quickly. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual and the brewery and distillery are in clear sight. There's no doubting why it is that you're there.\n\nPortside starting as a distillery so it should come as no surprise to find rum and rum-based drinks on their menu. I'm not into spirits myself but during our visit my wife enjoyed some sort of mixed drink with thyme in it. She liked it. I didn't. I was there for the beer. And beer there is. 14 taps were flowing that day. I wanted a flight of all of them. My wife (thankfully) talked me out of it. Sometimes I think I'm still in college and not 40. Anyway, they offer a handful of pre-built flights to help with your decision. I don't think it really matters. Just get a beer. You can't go wrong. Being a distillery you'll find plenty of barrel-aged beers, too.\n\nBecause it's probably some kind of law in Ohio that brewery taprooms offer some kind of food, Portside meets the requirement with a selection of munchies. Sugar-coated and spiced popcorn with peanuts, deviled eggs, hummus, soft pretzels...you get the idea. Just some stuff to help soak up the booze during your stay. I should have gotten the soft pretzels. The Crack'R Jak was ok.\n\nI don't have to say much about the service. Our bartenders were kind and attentive. Beers were filled drinks were mixed. Expectations were met.\n\nPortside doesn't have a very large distribution footprint. Actually, I don't think they make it that far outside of northeast Ohio. So if you want to try some of the most unique and innovative craft beer being brewed in Cleveland - and Ohio - you need to stop in after work sometime for their happy hour and take a tour of their taps.\n\nP.S.\nHey Portside, if you're reading this, how about putting your menu on Facebook or your website. Somewhere, man. A guy's gotta know.","date":"2015-02-22 19:35:10"}

I don't think it's on the menu, but I asked if they could make a bloody Mary one Saturday when we were in and I kid you not, it was the best bloody Mary I have ever had.  This was last fall\/early winter, so hopefully nothing has changed, but they have a homemade bloody Mary mix, and suggested using their olive-jalapeno infused silver rum.  I was a little hesitant at first - rum in a bloody Mary?  Don't think about it, just do it.  I thought I would have been back many times by now, but alas the limited food menu means we tend to end up elsewhere.  I do appreciate the food menu they do have, as this is a tasting room and not a restaurant or anything.  If I could make a suggestion to the management, it would be awesome to see a grilled cheese sandwich on the menu.
