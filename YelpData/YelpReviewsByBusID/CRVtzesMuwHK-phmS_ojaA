WAsn't expecting much because of the small selection, but everything turned out decent. The meatballs were actually baked into the pasta, instead of on the side which was a nice touch, but overall the dish could have used more sauce. Besides that the ricotta and mozzarella were all present and the thing was well baked.

Typically I go with the 1 slice + 6 wing & drink combo for $6.\n\nWhat detracts from the experience for me is the wait - today I ordered the above mentioned combo at 11:45 and while the wings arrived somewhat quickly, the slice of pepporoni pizza took a long time. I finally had a complete order and started eating at 12:15. The second thing is the size. This place is about the size of a closet - definitely sucks if you are trying to fit a group of people. By group I would say more than 3. There are a few tables in the main room, a couple outside and some in the back room. The problem is there is no traffic flow - the hallway between the rooms is narrow. If the tables are filled, which normally they are, people stand in the room, the hallway and make it challenging to get through. The fountain drink machine is in the back room and makes for a pile up while people try to find a spot, fill a drink and try to back out of the way.

Not to mention, their coupons are pretty sucky. And especially since ALL I can get is the GF pizza, it sucks that there are never any coupons I can actually use. I mean, it's pizza. Not a steak dinner.\nIf they had better prices, or better coupons, I'd definitely give them 5 stars. Because it is wonderful pizza.

Now, I am super picky about my pizza, as I have formerly worked at 5 pizza places and I am just sick of pizza in general, so pizza has to be stellar for me to eat it at all. Also, I LOVE wings and love hot\/spicy food. And I love vegetables! So, I skeptically opened the pizza to see, and it looked pretty good actually. Wow. It really was amazing! Lots of toppings, and extra cheesy! Then I tried the hot wings and they were really yummy, too. I felt some heat, so I decided to try the salad to cool things down, and I gotta say the salad was a perfect salad: super fresh and crisp ingredients, the perfect amount of toppings. I was very impressed! Obviously this restaurant uses high quality ingredients and cares about the quality of the food.\n\nAnyhow, even after I ate the salad, I wanted another wing...mind you only the second one.  After eating it, wow!!!...my mouth was on FIRE!! Now I like hot food, but holy moly these wings were HOT!  I drank milk, ate bread, and held and ice pack to my lips for 15 min before my mouth started to cool down! LITERALLY.

The sauce is not too sweet, not too acidic, and the cheese has a really good flavor that goes with the yummy crust. The crust is tasty too! For desert I love their cheesecake with added strawberries. The salads are fresh and interesting. I'm not much of a sald eater but their salads aren't boring.Try their fried zucchini with honey mustard!\nThe one thing I'm not a fan of is their spaghetti... but they are my default pizza place for sure!","date":"2015-11-22 17:09:12"}

Recently I was beyond impressed about how they handled overcharging me (slightly) on a beer on special. They offered to change the amount charged on my card or to just give me the difference in cash (that's actually unheard of for me). Big ups to them. \n\nThe pizza really is stellar. The only bad thing is that the quality somehow varies, but the floor and ceiling of the threshold is still very high (when it's good, it's out of this world). \n\nI always always always suggest getting slice specials. It makes ordering a breeze and helps them with preparing pizzas to meet demand. They are very generous to when it comes to replacing older pizzas with new ones if you ask. Do your best to try the mahgarita pizza. It's very rare but it's worth it if you see it. \n\nOne final note I would like to tell about this place is its generous ambiance. I'm actually a camper which is why I frequent restaurants without a wait staff so I don't hold them up. My friends and I bring laptops and cell phone charges and just chill here for hours and we have never once been asked to leave or move or anything. The staff will sometimes engage us and ask what we are up to because they are interested. I always feel a little uneasy that I'm taking up real estate there, but they've always let me feel welcome and for that, they have me for life.","date":"2017-07-12 07:30:42"}

Always have, always will. I am definitely in the category that believes it is good, even when it is bad. This place became a regular spot for me in high school and I have been going ever since. The slice special is the most bang for your buck you could hope for in a place like this. For just over 5 bucks you get 2 BIG slices and a drink (or a salad if you like) and given the quality I would take this over a 5 dollar large at any one of places in town that price that way. It's also been great to see the place grow over the years; and yet it has its drawbacks as well. Before they expanded, this place used first names rather than order numbers which definitely takes some of the pride out of being a long time fan. Also the demand has brought down the quality of the slices and salads, but only slightly. If you haven't been going regularly for years as I have then you probably wouldn't be able to tell. While Venezias has declined a bit, it still beats out the other popular New York style places in town like Slices on Mill. The slices tend to come out fresher whereas some of the competitors let theirs sit for just a bit too long. If you have never been, check this place out. You won't regret it, especially if you love a good slice as much as I do.","date":"2013-03-03 21:28:58"}

The last two times I have ordered, once was for delivery; the other was store pick-up.  \n\nIts a battle of pizza in Tempe, and when i spend almost 20 bucks for a pizza; I expect it to be pretty tasty.  The delivered pizza was not, in both sauce and toppings, it was nothing spectacular; and the delivery took almost an hr. Which, might of contributed to the pizza not being very good.\n\nMy most recent pizza, was in my assuming that a picked up pizza would be fresh and better than my delivery was. I was wrong; the white pizza (no sauce, olive oil and ricotta,) was possibly worse than the delivery. And, for 20 bucks I could of gotten 2 pizzas at jamies pizzeria in the neighborhood that I KNOW would of been better than this.  \n\nOh well, I don't know if their expansion has led to the quality going down, or that the place has many different locations now and as such whatever was special is no longer so, but its very obvious to me that whatever I thought was SO GOOD about venezias prior, is not.

However, I was told by more than a few people to try this place. Regretfully I made the trip today to try the pizza. \n\nI went over to the counter to order and the girl asked what I would like. I said I'd like a regular and they looked at me like I was an alien. I clarified by saying a plain slice. But, still no change. Saying a cheese slice finally got me somewhere. Now I know why out of staters in NYC always say cheese slice.\n\nAfter I paid. I went to sit down and waited what felt like forever. I was beginning to wonder if they were making each slice from scratch. I walked over by the counter to see what's going on and I see a conveyer belt style pizza oven. Now if you go to any pizzeria in NYC there's no way you'll see an oven that looks like that. It's usually Bakers Pride. Matter of fact the only place I had previously seen one of these ovens before was a Costco. This is when I knew I was about to be disappointed and I understood why it was taking so long they just thew everything in there and waited for it to come out. \n\nFinally, once my slice was ready I went up to the counter to get it. I was greeted by the biggest slice I had seen. This thing was the size of two regular slices in one. Which I guess wouldn't be a bad thing. If the pizza was actually good. \n\nLooking at the pizza, you can immediately tell this has nothing to do with a New York style pizza. The dough is way too thick and the crust way too soft. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers  on here. This thing was pretty much an equivalent of a Costco pizza. Actually, scratch that, you'd be better of getting a pizza from Costco not only does it taste way better - it's also cheaper.  \n\nAfter taking a bite from the slice I'm pretty sure I got 5x my daily value of sodium. There was more salt than pizza. I love pizza and I pretty much eat it whenever I can but, this was one of the worse slices I've ever ate and it was the only slice I threw away without finishing. Also what's with the substandard ingredients? Having Kraft \"Parmesan\" instead of the real stuff is just bad. \n\nFinally, anyone that claims this is anywhere close to New York style or any pizzeria on the East Coast is fooling themselves. In NYC you can get a slice for the price of a bus\/train fare. Here it's somehow more expensive and it's way worse.","date":"2017-08-11 06:35:01"}

It's big, greasy, and tasty.\n\nThey lose a star only because it's not quite there with NY's best, and it has been a little inconsistent in the past, although I haven't had much of a problem with that lately.  \n\nGreat value if you want a lunch close to $5.  Even a college student will find this place affordable.  Their wings are also delicious, and I have lately found myself gravitating towards a slice and wings instead of two slices.\n\nAlso, if you found this place cramped before, you should know that they recently remodeled.

Probably twice the size of what is normally served.\nVenezia's gets five stars because first they quoted me 45 min. and they were there in 45 min., everything was a reasonable price espicially for there larger than average portions, and, of course, the Cheesecake was amazing!

It's about time a real New Yorker like me stood up and informed everyone in the valley that this is NOT what pizza is like in New York. I think any pizza that isn't Chicago deep dish is called \"New York Style\" in the valley and I will deal with Gus' Pizza falsely claiming to be NY Style in a separate review. Venezia's pizza does have a very pleasant sauce and good tasting ingredients, but let's face it...it is RUBBERY like Domino's Pizza, even if the ingredients are a notch up. A New Yorker never eats pizza at a chain restaurant and would NEVER put up with the size and price scheme that Venezia is running. Let it be known that what Venezia calls an XL (EXTRA LARGE) pie is slightly smaller in diameter than the normal standard size pizza in NYC.  Their so-called \"Large\" pie is an insult to consumers. That is what NYC pizzeria's call either a \"small pie,\" \"bar pie,\" or \"personal pie.\" I once asked for a little extra cup of sauce on the side and they wanted to charge me for it. That's the kind of utilitarian drain-every-nickel corporate chain attitude that you would NEVER see in a NYC pizzeria. Venezia's is NOT authentic Italian.\n\nWith everything I've just said, Venezia's is still probably the best pizza in the valley...THE TALLEST MIDGET IN THE ROOM in the valley of fake inauthentic overpriced ethnic food!

By 6:50pm we still hadn't received our order. I called to see if maybe the online order didn't send. I spoke to a gentlemen who informed me that they were low on drivers and that a manager had picked up my order 10min's ago to deliver it herself. 15 min after I spoke to him the person delivering the pizza called and explained she was lost. We had ordered from Venenzia's for delivery before with the previous drivers having no problem finding our home. I gave her directions and about 5 min later she showed up. Even with the late delivery I left a standard tip for her and brought the pizza inside. It's 7:10pm by this point and my boys were so excited it finally arrived. We open the pizza box and it was clear the pizza had been sitting out for quite awhile. The pizza was cold and the wings were room temp. The condensation from the packaging had left them soggy and inedible. Frustrated after waiting close to 2hrs for a medium pizza and single order of wings I call to speak to management. I was placed on hold and eventually was disconnected. I decided to drive the order back and ask for a refund. The gentlemen at the counter was apologetic and offered to remake the order ensuring it would take 10-15 min. 20min's later our order was called. The counter lady didn't stay long enough for me to tell her we were missing half our order, the wings. After ignoring us for awhile she came back long enough for me to tell her we did not receive the wings with the pizza order. She asked us to give them 5 more min to get them out...  by 8:15 we finally left with our correct order. The pizza and wings were tasty but absolutely not worth waiting well over 2 1\/2 hrs for. I rated them two stars, one for taste and the other for the gentlemen at the counter being the only one in the building caring about rectifying the poor service. Note to self and to anyone reading this... Do not order from Venezia's during peak hours, ever!","date":"2015-10-30 03:54:45"}

I went in person to place a to-go order and the place was really busy - it was filled with people sitting down to eat, waiting for to pick-up a phone order, and placing to-go orders. The woman who took my order was still really friendly and patient, despite how busy it was. I ordered a large one-topping pizza ($10.50 with a coupon I found in the paper menu sitting on the counter), a dozen Honey Hot boneless wings ($7.99), and a small salad ($2.99). The wait was 20-25 minutes but the woman was upfront about how long it would be, and the food was definitely worth the wait!\n\nThe pizza was really good - tomato sauce that was savory, not sweet, the right amount of real mozzarella, and a crust that was the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. The wings weren't the best I've ever had, but they used good-quality chicken and had a pretty flavorful sauce. The salad was also pretty good, with fresh lettuce and pepperoncinis. A lot of pizza places skimp on the salad, but this was a decent side salad for ~$3. \n\nVenezia's is a great place to get good-quality NY pizza and sides. They deliver, but I'm not sure how far they'll go. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.","date":"2008-06-30 04:22:00"}

And the prices are fantastic! $3.50 for a slice and soda, and the slices are huge! I usually can't even finish a slice. $5.50 or so for 2 slices and a soda. About the same for a slice and a salad. I mean, really, you can't get much better than that! And their pizza is pretty close to perfect. I'm a fan of their sausage, their pepperoni and their meat combo.

It's the restaurant's largest size pie. It's the slices from that size pie that go on sale as individual slices. If you order a pizza pie to go that isn't a party pizza (say a large or XL) you get a different size pizza that I believe actually tastes different. \n\nThe slices are actually excellent. It truly is NY style Neopolitan pizza and the chicken wings are good too. Service is nothing what you'd expect in a pizzeria though.\n\nIt's NY style pizza but not NY style service. Everything is done slowly and overly methodically. The Tempe location is a crowded, narrow, suck-in- your-gut to pass by someone kind of place. That's not unlike other pizzerias, but in other places you only have to wait around for your order if you have something that needs to be cooked. \n\nVenezias makes you wait in some kind of pecking order to get your slice when a server behind the counter reads your name off of the register receipt. That's just bizarre. For a small cramped place that gets crowded during lunch they waste so much time asking every customer their name and then typing it into the register so it prints on the receipt. \n\nAlso, this is a pizzeria, not a fine italian restaurant. There is not a need for luxo-looking pleather booths and chairs to go along with fancy new tables. The old rickety ones were just fine. \n\nThis is a grab a meal and go place, not a break out the candles and wine kinda joint. The metal tables and chairs you have outside are just fine. The new accommodations take up valuable space in an otherwise cramped dining area.\n\nGood pizza, good wings, strange service and prices that have risen steadily over the past few years. It it were more efficient I'd give it another star, I'd even go there to eat more often than I do.\n\nAddendum: As of the Fall 09 this place has expanded and is actually too big. It's quite comfortable though and patrons seem to spend a longer amount of time there than before. There are a few flat screens on the wall too. Their method is still strange  and they call slice orders out over a microphone. Sit in the back dining room and you might not hear your name. Service even got a bit friendlier. I added an additional star (going from 3 to 4) for the renovations and friendlier service.","date":"2008-09-29 16:05:18"}

I couldn't really taste anything I mean it had sliced tomatoes on it and I couldn't real even taste them. It was mega bland, like a white rice and unflavored chicken kinda bland.

The second slice was like flavor country after such a bland slice. But then I was like man this is kinda dry, the cheese also does not have much flavor, pepperonis are kinda meh. Does this even have pizza sauce? \n\nI went to this place starving it should have been great, even with a heightened sense of smell and taste it was bland and dry.

Why spend 5 bucks on this when I can get a whole pizza for the same price that actually tastes better? Can't speak for the rest of the menu but the pizza is really sub par.

It has become a delivery staple, especially in a Tempe where most delivery places are really bad.","date":"2014-01-28 02:01:40"}

Great slice\/combo specials. A slice, 6 wings, and a drink is more than enough to fill me up. The pizza is good, the staff are friendly, and even the wings are good. \n\nI like to get the slice combos, but they don't really bake the toppings into the pizza, so they kind of fall off (unless the pizza was already cooked with the toppings). Otherwise, the crust, sauce, and cheese are all very good.\n\nThe wings are pretty amazing as well. I like honey hot is weird, its like hot but just honey on top, and its very watery, which makes the wings soggy. Weird. The mustard hot and hot are pretty good complements to a slice of pizza.\n\nI did the party pizza challenge with a friend. Its a little tough, about 10 slices per person, but definitely doable. We weren't on drugs when we did it like some other people were, who somehow happened to finish it in 5-10 minutes. Ie, at the Tempe location, two sorority looking girls did it in 15 (they probably weighed no more than 200 lbs combined). Meanwhile, my friend and I, weighing in around 350 lbs did it in 35 minutes. Am I whining about a food contest? No, just don't try this expecting to get it done.\n\nThis place has been pretty consistent the few times I've been there. I appreciate that. I hate it when a place is awesome the first two or three times, then it drops off in quality and can be a coin flip every time you go. So far its been very consistent.\n\nThey stay well connected with their patrons on FB\/twitter. I won a free slice through a contest. Free stuff is always cool. It shows that they appreciate us.\n\nAhh the raiting. This was close. I can't think of anything particularly special about this place. The pizza isn't special, the wings aren't special, and I haven't tried much else. However, I wouldn't hesitate to come here ever, and there are times when I get cravings for this place. There isn't much in Tempe that is close to this sorta stuff. My baby brother loves this place as well, and so does my GF. I'm sure they'll never say no if I wanted to come here, so I think that means this place deserves a 5.","date":"2010-11-06 06:22:27"}

I'd just be sure to order and eat there! Here's why....\n\nThis was the first time I've ordered from here. And for full disclosure, I'm not a big pizza fan like I was in high school. Mostly because my tastes have somewhat changed and l haven't  found many that taste spectacular. \n\nBut, the pictures people posted looked really good, and my house munchkin saw the chicken and fries and wanted that... so I ordered!\n\nWhen the food arrived, it looked great! It was on time and my GrubHub guy even kept the Cannoli separate from the warm foods. I just wish it had tasted as great as it looks.\n\nAnd to be clear, I don't ever expect delivery to be as good as eating it AT the restaurant. But, I also don't mind having to reheat or crisp up my delivery food as needed.\n\nHaving said that, here's the breakdown...\n\nMunchkin's chicken and fries... The fries were super soggy, even for delivery! I tossed them in the toaster oven to see if I could crisp them up. Ten minutes later, they were more crisp.... but they were a weird chewy texture. So we decided to skip the fries.\n\nI didn't have to reheat the chicken because then I'd just have to let it cool down for the 4-year-old! She liked that part, so she ate the just the chicken. I figured what the heck, a lot of restaurants don't do kids meals very well (even though they should!) \n\nThe garlic bread... not bad, but nothing super special. I reheated it a bit in the toaster oven too. It coulda used some more garlic and seasoning, but we liked it well enough to eat most if it.\n\nThe pizza... I ordered one of their large slices with pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese. Im glad I ordered extra though, because it was the amount I get normally at the pizza place I usually call. \n\nThe good part is, since I don't eat as much as I used to, there was enough there to fill me up, share with the munchkin, AND still have leftovers (in 4-year-old portion size) for breakfast. I had put it in the oven for a few minutes to reheat and remelt the cheese as well. \n\nThis was by far the best part of what we ordered. And that makes sense... order piza from a pizza place right? But even that wasn't something I'd order again... unless I was in a hurry, was hungry for pizza, and could eat it fresh at the restaurant. \n\nAnd my thought is, regardless of your specialty, if you're not gonna cook the rest of it as well, then don't have it on the menu!! \n\nAnd finally, the Cannoli... not my kind of dessert maybe? The crust was a hard crunchy pastry and I hed expected something a little flakier and the filling, while not a bad flavor, had a gritty texture vs a smooth pudding or custard type thing. Again, it could just be me as this is the first time I've ever had it!","date":"2016-12-16 00:43:42"}

They use a Middleby Marshall oven (same type used by Dominos where the pies are cooked on a conveyor).  The real pizza joints in NJ \/ NY will generally use a Bakers Pride where they drop the pizza, close the oven door in and turn it occasionally with a pizza peal.  At the risk of sounding like a pizza nerd, I think the crispiness and flavor of a pizza cooked in the Bakers Pride is superior with the Middleby giving a rubbery texture.  The pizza here was somewhat akin to a Dominos pizza.  Now they did give me a lot of cheese and were generous with the toppings but for me the crust is crucial...and this crust was just ok.

The slices were huge, there was always a huge selection of pizzas on display, and the wings were great.

The pizzas weren't always warm, if you asked for say a mushroom slice, be prepared to get canned mushroom thrown on a reheated cheese slice.  The wings weren't always warm either, and sometimes lacked the sauce that once made these wings great.  Recently, I've noticed that they've gotten rid of the punch cards (I guess not many people were using them anyway), and my favorite honey-hot wings.  Instead, I was told that I could get honey-mild wings, or get hot wings and pay for a side of honey.

From what I can tell, from some of the Yelp responses, the owner seems to be Italian. I mean with a name like (Dominick M.) I am assuming he is Italian. But perhaps, if he weren't, it might explain why this pizza place is run the way it is. But anyway, if he comes from my home town of Chicago (not likely because no one from Chicago would ever put NY on their pizza place), or any of the East Coast Cities, like New York, Providence or Philadelphia, he has obviously lost his way. The kids he is hiring, know nothing about service, let alone pizza or the traditional neighborhood Italian pizza place. This could be forgiven, I know ASU kids come from all over the country (but provide some training, for crying out loud). But what can't be forgiven, is the way they sell pizza by the slice. When pizza is sold by the slice, it is one price across the board (with possible exception for cheese pizza). This place tries to charge $2.79 for the base cheese and sauce on the slice, plus .45 cents for each topping. Leaving one to break out the calculator, count toppings and add up what the cost of each type of pizza slice is (an absolutely ridiculous way of pricing slices). Then there is happy hour pricing, with a dollar off per slice, but that starts at 8 PM. Again ridiculous, one, because I did not see a bar in this pizza place, two, this is not the type of place I would go to drink for happy hour because they don't serve spirits. I cannot say with 100% certainty that they did not have a bar because I did not get past the bubble head working the register, who could not explain the pricing structure of pizza by the slice, before I got frustrated and walked out.  But I guess they do serve beer and wine because a sign in the window indicated that they had just gotten their B&W license. Anyway, I can't speak to the quality of the food because I did not eat there, but if it is anything like the customer service or restaurant management, I am sure I did not miss much.

The specials include 1 slice, 2 slices, 1 slice and 6 wings, 1 slice and a salad and much more. The specials include a fountain drink as well. Just to give you a price point I usually get the 2 slice, 1 topping special with a drink and that is $5.75 plus tax.

There is plenty of seating and usually sports on the televisions.\n\nAll-in-all this is a great place for the following reasons:\n1.

I wanted to try some place new. While browsing different menus of various pizza places, I was sold on this one because I saw that they carried golden wings which are my favorite.\n\nOn their website they had different specials and I decided on the family special which consisted of 2 large one items and 2 dozen wings for $31.99. Pretty decent deal I thought. I added an extra topping on each pizza and my total was just under $40. \n\nI like my pizza extra crispy so when I got home, I popped the pizzas in the oven for a little while to crisp them up. They were pretty good. I think it definitely made it more enoyable that I crisped them up in the oven for a few minutes. MY favorite type of pizzas are wood fired thin crust ones, but for NY style, these are rated pretty up there. \n\nWings were decent. They are pretty good sized wings and the sauce was on point. I'd imagine they would be better eaten in house freshly made. The crispiness was no longer there after being closed up in a box and making the drive home. As you can probably tell, I like everything crispy :) But still I liked them. They also had a handful of other flavors to choose from but I'm pretty much sold on golden wings everywhere they carry them. \n\nVenezia would be a top pick if I was craving for NY style pizza. I would order from here again, or actually maybe dine in next time, so everything could be eaten freshly made. Also, huge plus that the restaurant looked cleaned and organized. I actually imagined it to be a little dinkier, but to my surprise it looked like a place that could possibly be suitable for a casual date.","date":"2011-02-07 17:32:07"}

He left his secure job to start slinging pizza's full time and hasn't looked back.   \n\nI miss not having one of their pizza's at least once a month and last night we decided to order a pizza for dinner and I also had one of their small tossed salads.  \n\nI have yet to be disappointed with any of their food.   The homemade lasagna is awesome.  Their tossed salad is more then just a couple of pieces of wilted lettuce and cherry tomatoes. They have cucumbers and some wonderful peppers, which really adds to the flavor, and a plethora of croutons.\n\nWe always order one of the specialty pizzas the Venezias Special.  It's made of awesome goodness.   If it were up to me I would eat one of the Park Avenue or White pizza because those are my absolute favorite.  \n\nThe prices are higher than a chain restaurant but you also get what you pay for.

Venezia's caught my eye as I had driven by it many times and it had good reviews on yelp. Hopped in the car and headed there. It had a pretty steady crowd which was a good sign. I thought I would order a whole pizza, but then while in online I got into a dilemma. Should I order a whole pie or get slices and try several different types of pizzas. Since I couldn't decide on one pizza I went with 3 slices and even those were hard to decide on since they had so many choices. I had to get a plain cheese slice as you can never go wrong with the classic. I also chose a spicy pepperoni slice and a pesto slice. The slices were great and quite big. I think 2 slices would have been enough, but I chose the third one cause I had to try more. The place was nice and big enough for groups. It also was lined with TVs in case you wanted to watch a sports event so that was cool.","date":"2015-03-25 15:49:17"}

When planning for Scott's 50th Birthday, he wanted pizza. So, I contacted AJ the GM at this location to see if they would deliver a catering order; he got back to me via email and phone by first thing the next morning. \n\nWe stopped in to this location during late lunch and sat down with AJ to discuss our needs:\n\n1) food for 25 people. \nB) I over order and overcook, always. \n3) we are from NY: no Ranch with pizza. Ever (no wings either. They are separate things!)\nD) suggestions for popular items. \n\nAJ suggested their extra large (24\") pizzas cut square style, and we went with pepperoni, supreme, 1\/2 white & 1\/2 Margarita, and chicken pesto. We also ordered an antipasto salad, Greek salad, two trays of meatballs, and two orders of cheesy breadsticks. AJ emailed me a copy of the receipt and advised that we could change order up till 6PM the day of party. He was very responsive to my queries and changes, super nice guy! \n\nMat the delivery driver texted me when he was on the way, and brought the aforementioned, along with serving spoons, two bottles of dressing, grated cheese and red pepper flakes, and plates with extra plastic cutlery. He was very polite and professional. \n\nAll of our guests loved the food: those who have had Venezia's before were pumped, and newbies were raving. 1\/3 of our guests are also native NYers, and agreed with the thin crust being the bees knees. \n\nAJ went above and beyond to assure me I'd ordered enough food, kept in touch, provided bomb food, and followed up today to see how the party went. It went perfectly thanks to the great food and service from Venezia's, and we will definitely visit again, sooner than later. Keto be damned: that chicken pesto pizza is terrific! Their sausage crumbles are spicy and delicious, and filled-to-order cannoli are great too. We are absolute fans!","date":"2017-10-01 00:20:34"}

The pizza slices are huge, the slice specials are very nicely priced, and it is never so crowded I hate coming here. I have been to this location and the one in East Mesa, and I have to say that this one is way better. The pizza just tastes better, even though its the exact same pizza. We usually only get slices. We tried a whole pizza one time, but for some reason it just didn't taste the same as the slices. I don't know what that's about but in my opinion the slices are a better value anyways. My husband and I can eat dinner of two slices each, and each with a drink for under $15. And that's a win in my book. I usually end up taking one of the slices home for lunch the next day as well. So I get more than one meal out of it. \n\nIf you want to eat some good, cheap pizza, definitely hit this place up. The pizza comes out hot, fast, and delicious.

There was nothing to it, I had to add every spice at the table to get anything out of it and didn't eat a whole piece.\nThen, the supreme - This was slightly more edible, but I promise you, if I closed my eyes, I would think I was eating a supreme pizza from Costco. Again, the cheese was NOT fresh or at least not fresh and of quality.\nThen the crust, I didn't eat it, I ate the toppings of the supreme only, because it was flavorless had no depth or crunch at all.

It has potential to be one of the best NY style pizza places I've reviewed, but I've had a few disappointing experiences among my handful of visits.\n \nIf you're coming into Venezia's, you have to come for the slices. The extra-long slices exemplify what a good NY pizza is all about. The most impressive part of this pizza is the crust, which is crispy and chewy at the same time. The strength in the crust means it can hold up easily and maintain foldability even in those extra-long slices. Venezia's keeps the crust appropriately thin, which makes the gluten strength even more impressive. Even though it has a good textured bite, it isn't dry or rigid. Though it doesn't always jump out at you with flavor, this is a pizza crust done well with really well developed structure and cooked just right. \n\nThe sauce brings a subtle all-around blend of flavors where nothing really dominates. There's sweetness, garlic, and a really understated spiciness that balances non-offensively. It's a very serviceable sauce. It won't knock your socks off but it does exactly what it needs to do. The pizza is topped with a good ratio of cheese, almost bordering on too much but usually within acceptable limits. Every pizza I've eaten has had really good brown spotting you look for in a NY slice. \n\nI've also ordered carry-out whole pies and I don't think I would recommend this. The features of the crust that I really enjoyed disappear when you put it into a box. I'm guessing the heat and steam from the pizza get trapped and kind of soften everything down. The resulting slice is still pretty good, but it is noticeably worse than the in-person extra-large slices. There's nothing too special about the sauce and the cheese distribution can err on heavy handedness and the formation of the dreaded cheese blanket. \n\nPerhaps the slices gave me high expectations that are not easily matched. I'm not sure if it has to do with ordering smaller sizes, but I've yet to have a whole delivery pizza I liked as much as the individual portions, especially at the price. For delivery, I might just save the extra money and get Dominos. For slices, Venezia's is hard to beat.","date":"2016-09-26 16:25:44"}

If you are looking for that review, stop reading. If you are someone like me who is over the age of 25 and is interested in finding a great pizzeria and craves NY style pizza then this review is for you.\n\nThe pizza is good but disappointing. There are better NY style pizzerias in the valley....much better... Rays, Gus', Jimmy and Joe's Pizza. The pizza has a lot of yeast so you feel full after two slices.  The yeast also takes away from the flavor.  The cheese lacks flavor and tastes as if there is little salt in it. The meat toppings such as their Italian sausage is small and has little flavor. They advertise as if they are an authentic Sicilian style pizzeria but it honestly tastes like imitation NY style pizza. \n\nI would strongly suggest not ordering their 12 inch pizzas. They won't feed 2 people and are basically slightly larger than a personal pizza.  Go with the 16 inch.  About the pizzeria itself....Yes, you can eat there but this joint should be viewed as a carry-out only place. The only people eating there are teenagers or college students who are grabbing a bite to eat before they go out or after they come back from the bars.

As I entered the restaurant I was about to get in line when the cashier mentioned that she could help me at her register (having me avoid walking through the line.  how nice of her!)  I was thanking her as I was walking towards her and she raised her voice at me and said \"I can't hear you from over there.\"\nOk jeeze lady you didn't have to respond so rudely and so loudly.  I admit that I can be a bit shy and quiet when I'm talking, but all I was doing was thanking her.  Even if she didn't hear my thank you, she shouldn't have been rude to me and raised her voice.

Toppings included mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions and black olives.

If you want skim milk mozz with modified food starch added, go to Papa Johns. The bigger point here is, their pizza is not even that greasy! Do yourself a favor, hop aboard the Venezia's fanclub train and experience on of the better pies in the valley! Bonus, they manage to have great customer service even when the line is out the door!","date":"2016-12-30 16:24:39"}

I hate writing negative reviews but I feel like this is the only way I'm going to get a resolution.\n\nLast night at about 8:45pm my boyfriend had finally gotten home from a long day of running errands so we decided to order in. We ordered using GrubHub which I don't think that has anything to do with the negative experience. GrubHub informed me that the restaurant would stop taking delivery orders at 9:45pm and I ordered at 8:50ish.\n\nI ordered two separate 1\/2 orders of wings because I wanted all wings and he wanted a mix of both wings and drums. He also wanted different sauce than me. We also ordered the mac n cheese bites. \n\nThe order was delivered within about an hour which is pretty normal when you order extra crispy wings but when I got the order and took it out of the bag is when we had the issue. The first thing I pulled out was the mac n cheese bites. There were only about 4 or 5 tiny chicken nugget looking pieces... actually they were smaller than chicken nuggets but what made me even more frustrated was that they were in a paper basket with no lid on top. They were just thrown in with a bunch of napkins on top instead of a lid. It almost looked like they took a dine in order of the bites and threw them in a to-go bag with little to no care. They were gross too. I set those aside and pulled out another box. This was an actual \"to go box.\" when I opened it up the wings were naked with sauce on the side as requested, but there were 7 wings in the box, 4 were wings and 2 were drums. I figured that these were my boyfriends since he wanted a 1\/2 order with both wings and drums. Well, I realized that... that was the only box of wings that we received. Just one box of 7 wings and the mac n cheese bites. I did not receive my order at all. I went to call the restaurant to let them know they forgot an order, but by the time we got our order, they were already closed for the night and didn't open until today at 10:30am. I called at around 11:30 to tell a manager about my experience the night before, but I was placed on hold and nobody came back on the line. I'm not going to mention the employees name because I am not wanting to get that person in trouble, they didn't do anything wrong. I really wanted to resolve this over the phone instead of writing the review... but if the manager would have just come to the phone and not kept me on hold forever... we wouldn't be here. I was charged 30 dollars for 7 wings and like 5 small mac n cheese bites. So my boyfriend and I had like 3 wings each for dinner last night, we threw the bites out because they were disgusting and cold. Unacceptable in my opinion. I'm sorry if my order was the last of the night and you all wanted to just go home... but if you don't want to make and deliver food that late, don't allow orders that late. It was lazy and careless.","date":"2018-10-15 21:04:58"}

It is amazing how badly some places can screw up a food that is so simple.  Dough, sauce, cheese.  Venezia's does a good job of making a simple and tasty slice in the way I like it.  Greasy and limp enough to need a fold.\n\nI have eaten slices there and gotten pies to go.  The trick to Venezia's is always get the slices or order the same size pie that they serve there.  I think it is 18\" or so.  The smaller pies just don't have the same quality of thinness.  They have a nice little combo of 2 slices and a drink for 6 bucks or so.  The slices are very big (they cut an 18\" pie into 10 slices I think) and you will be more than stuffed.  \n\nWith all this being said, I too have a pet peeve with a place that uses a conveyor belt (1 star deduction for it).  I prefer to to have my pizza guy with heat burns on his face from slaving over a giant oven and be able to cook\/reheat my slices to perfection.  For what it's worth though, they make the best pizza on a belt.  When the options for cheap, greasy, and flimsy pizza are minimal, I can't be too picky.  Aside from how they make it, the end result is all that really matters and they pull it off.  \n\nThe place is very big inside and always clean.  It is hidden in a strip mall.  I live about a 1\/2 mile away and didn't find out about it for a few years until reading reviews for it.  For Tempe, it is the best traditional-ish option when it comes to the simple goodness.","date":"2010-08-05 02:47:36"}

Let's break down the good, the bad and the ugly about this establishment! \n\nThe Good. They deliver quite far and when they deliver the pizza is still hot and fresh, almost like they took it out of oven, stepped in a Star Trek teleporter and knocked on your door. I got the meat lovers the first time I had them and I've been in love every since. When I took that first bite.....the way the cheeses and meats and spices all merged together and melted in my mouth.... I became mentally and foodmotionally  distressed and stood in my kitchen unsure of what to do next because the flavors just blew me away. I ended up skipping the plate and took the entire box and sat in front of the TV and snuggle ate. Which brings me to my next point... \n\nMore good news, it reheats really well the next day. Again more foodgasms to be had! The next time I had them I went and ordered dine in with a friend (the establishment is really nice!). She too was overwhelmed in a great way. I was having a bad day that day so I did what any logical thinking woman would do,  I ordered cheesecake.... again MY GOD! \n\nEither way I've said enough! Just go...or order in at home. \n\nOh by the way there is no bad or ugly... Well I take that back...when they say their wings are hot... THEY ARE HOT...so use discretion but whatever happens with that is between you, your esophagus, and the porcelain Gods which may get ugly depending on what kind of relationship you have with aforementioned Gods.  5 stars from me all the way!","date":"2016-01-16 00:52:09"}

A lot of the pizzas looked really tempting, but we opted for the simple, large one topping pizza (pepperoni), so we could take advantage of the Yelper discount that was available.  We also got an order of the family-size breadsticks.\n\nVenezia gets big points for having an online ordering form!  Nicely done!\n\nBut they lose a few points for taking over an hour to deliver to just a few miles away.  Yes, yes, I realize they're probably consistently hoppin', but 60 minutes to get my foodstuffs was a little longer than I'd normally be willing to wait for pizza.\n\nThat being said, the pizza and breadsticks did arrive warm, despite the long wait.  Everything was really tasty, definitely some good pizza here!  I was a big fan of the crust.  Just thick enough not to be obnoxious.  And obviously still foldable to be considered NY style, right?

My personal favorite is the chicken pesto since it's overloaded with chicken.  \n\nWhile this is a pizza place their wings and calzones are also worth a try.","date":"2016-05-17 22:57:01"}

NY style means large, thin slices of pizza that you have to fold to eat.  I didn't really find any of this when we ordered a large pizza to go.  The dough was too thick, and it ended up tasting like a regular style pizza you can get anywhere.  Sure, I'm not expecting 100% authenticity here since we are on the opposite end of the U.S., but I didn't really see any semblance of NY in this pizza.  In addition, our mushroom pizza hardly had any mushrooms in it, and the ones that were in there were shriveled, small, and hidden inside the pizza- I probably wouldn't have noticed any difference in taste in this mushroom pizza from a regular cheese pizza.  We ordered a dozen honey hot wings as well, which I liked substantially better.  They were a nice combination of spicy, salty, and sweet.","date":"2010-11-20 18:14:29"}

Growing up in Chicago, I am definately a fan of deep dish. However, in my travels I have grown to love many of the different types of pizza made in this great country. As a result, I've had some horrible pizza and some pizza that would make you smack your grandma. \n\nWhen I stumbled upon Venezia's last year, I was skeptical. I've grown very picky over the years and was having a hard time finding pizza in tempe. So I did a random google search for pizza in Tempe and came across venezia's. Since then, my family has had a torrid love affiar with this wonderful establishment.\n\n\nTheir pizza is awesome. The crust is always perfect and the sauce isn't too sweet. They do tend to go a little heavy on the cheese at times but it doesn't seem like overkill. Their calzones, wings and cheese bread are also delicious. We tried some of their desserts last time and they were great.\n\nThe service here is wonderful. I love a place that I can order online. Nothing stinks more than having to repeat yourself 15 times to the person on the other line who is standing in the loud pizza shop. The food always comes hot and fresh. They actually have cheese and peppers with them which is always nice.\n\nTheir prices are great too. Perfect for something that tastes so wonderful.","date":"2010-05-11 03:55:44"}

A friend of mine had constantly raved about it so when I was in the area we finally hit it up. When he told me to get the 2 slices and a drink special, I was perplexed.\n\n\"Do you want to split an order of wings or something too?\", I asked him.\n\n\"No, the two slices is enough food. Trust me.\"\n\n\"Two slices? I'm a grown man, son.\"\n\nIn my stubbornness I ended up ordering some wings with the pizza. As usual, it turns out I made a mistake. When you're eating with veterans of a food establishment, listen to what they have to say. The slices showed up and they were just massive. Apparently the single serving slices come from the huge party size pizza which I'm yet to have ordered. I was full after both slices and a couple of wings, and this was despite me putting in significant effort to eat all of the wings to prove how right I was. \n\nThe pizza itself is nothing too special, but is extremely greasy with good crust. They pack the cheese on too, which is always commendable. Basically, this is really good pizza at an affordable price. You can eat two slices of pizza and get a drink for around $5-6 and can order pizzas at a price very similar to that of the large chains.\n\nThe above is why Venezia's is great. They effectively replace all of the pizza delivery chains with better pizza at a similar price AND have single cheap meals AND have good sit down areas. It's not gourmet pizza. It's probably not better than some place you wait in line to sit down in a restaurant and pay $20+ for your medium pizza. Venezia's is just delicious, affordable, convenient local pizza. That, boys and girls, is the type of place you get the most utility from. I have probably eaten here more than anywhere else since moving to Tempe with the possible exception of Haji Baba.\n\nThey also have excellent wings and some really awesome daily specials. For example, on Fridays you can buy extra large cheese pizzas at $6 each after buying one at normal price. The staff is friendly and they have fairly late hours. Oh, Don't get the Italian Stallion pizza. The description is great but it's just not that good.","date":"2009-02-10 06:18:06"}

Slices have been pretty tasty at a low price. I like the environment. Last time we got one of those HUGE whole pizzas to go, extra sauce. Sauce was not really flavorful and the toppings were ok. The slices were abnormally larger than the already LARGE individual slices so it was really hard to handle the slices. Plates not big enough for slices so a portion the pizza is touching the table. Its not cut all the was thru in the box so you have to recut with your pizza slicer and the box is already soggy from the toppings and sauce so we ended up cutting all the way through the box. It was just an awkward experience and I don't think I would ever order this huge pizza again, even though I am more than willing to go back for the individual slices. It was an experience non the less and I can definitely cross this off my bucket list.

Seriously, its awesome. Excellent if you just want to stop in and grab a slice or get a party pie (2 or 3 feet across, gigantic!) delivered to your home. They also make Sicilian pies! That is amazing in the valley, no one has Sicillian! \n\nTheir sandwiches are also great, at least the hot ones. The cold ones suffer from the problem that all cold sandwiches in the valley suffer. We just can't seem to get ham, roast beef and turkey right here in AZ. Its weird, seems easy, but there's just something off with the cold cuts in the valley. \n\nThe staff is rather young and not very experienced. There is a lot of turnover. So there are issues where you ask for a meatball parmigiana sandwich and are told that there isn't one...you have to tell them that a meatball sub and and a meatball parmigiana sandwich are the same thing.\n\nAs an east coaster I always have to remember to not order subs as heroes, as then I have to argue what is on my gyro. Because gyro is pronounced (by Greeks at diners as well) in NY with a hard 'g', largely IMHO because subs are called heroes. \n\nNonetheless, their delivery is great and the food is excellent!
