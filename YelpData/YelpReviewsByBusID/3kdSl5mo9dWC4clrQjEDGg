I'm not an egg person but i decided to give it a try since my party chose this place. I got the traditional Benny which came out to be so delicious. I checked in on yelp and got a free banana muffin which also was delicious! It wasn't dry or nasty. It was perfect. They also have a cute idea of flipping over a plastic egg to a sad face when you need something. We needed some extra tortillas and flipped our egg to a sad face and they came immediately. My plate came with a side of potatoes which tasted amazing. I'm so glad I gave this place a try! Open to trying new places now.","date":"2018-01-09 21:42:37"}

There were a lot of positive reviews on Yelp, plus who doesn't love cute eggs! The parking lot had a lot of space, so finding a spot is nothing to worry about. \n\nUpon entering, the place was EXTREMELY packed. We had to wait quite a bit, but this wasn't a problem at all. Although I do wish there were more chairs indoors so other people could sit down while waiting in the front area of the restaurant. After being seated we were given menus which were creatively in newspaper form, so it was like we were reading our morning newspaper while waiting for breakfast! \n\nEveryone at the table ordered some freshly squeeze orange juice after being questioned by the waiter. In addition, I ordered a crepe and a strawberry french toast. The orange juice and crepe was nothing special, but the sauce definitely was delicious and spiced up the meal 1000%. However, THE BANANA MUFFIN was something else. It was soft, warm and delicious (probably the best part of the meal). \n\nOverall the food and service was pretty good, this place is a very cute breakfast place and definitely worth a try!","date":"2018-09-03 01:41:58"}

The egg was thick and dry and the only good thing about it was the avocado chunks inside. Big pieces of avocado. That's IT.  The potatoes it came with were not good. Just deep fried potatoes. The side of fruit was much better. The corned beef hash was mushy and had a lot of potatoes. Was disappointed in that too.

We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, which was fine.  \n\nLooking at the menu, I quickly locked onto the biscuits & gravy meal (with eggs and potatoes).  I'm a complete sucker for this meal and decided to give it a try.  \n\nWhen I ate my meal, I discovered the biscuits weren't homemade (and were crumbly) and the gravy was unremarkable.  You can't really screw up scrambled eggs.  The potatoes were wildly over seasoned and virtually unbearable to eat. \n\nI rate the Egg & I biscuits & gravy as a \"5\" (on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best I've ever had, which is at Arthur's Family Restaurant located in Orange, CA). \n\nThe service was fine and the food came out fast.

While the potatoes are really delicious, I opted to switch it out with cottage cheese (weird, I know). I just knew the potatoes would be way too heavy for me along with the bread, which comes pre-buttered! Tastes delicious with the various jams already at the table.  \n+BANANA MUFFIN: Check in so you get the free, super tasty muffin. It's delicious and moist. (Maybe not for people who don't like the banana flavors.)\n\nThe service here is incredibly friendly. With a group of 10, it can get kinda hectic and things can be forgotten, but that didn't seem to be the case. We also were easily able to ask for more muffins (because deliciousness). There's also this egg flipping signage to let the staff know if you need anything.

It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and enjoy a fantastic breakfast! We got to the restaurant around 8:30 AM on a Sunday and didn't have to wait for a table. The place started filling up soon after and we looked to be the only non-locals there.\n\nWe ordered the Three Pigs Omelette and Works Veggie Benny to share. Both come with a huge helping of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. I love fried potatoes so I inhaled all of mine, which was a nice little accomplishment because the plates was huge and the potatoes took up half the plate! If you order an omelette, you also get a choice of toast or their famous homemade banana nut muffin. We read reviews and perused photos beforehand so of course we chose the muffin. You also get a free muffin with Yelp check-in so be sure to do so!\n\nThe banana nut muffins here are everything you could ever want in a muffin. Moist, fluffy, flavorful, and warm--they blow all other muffins I have ever had way out of the water. My mouth is watering as I write because they are THAT good. \n\nThe Three Pigs Omelette was stuffed with diced ham, bacon, and sausage and topped with cheddar and jack cheese. It was good but we should have ordered something more exciting. The menu here is extensive but our waitress kind of rushed us to order. I am guessing she's used to local patrons who order quickly. The Works Veggie Benny was incredibly satisfying. The hollandaise sauce was as egg-ceptional as the menu claims and the combination of the sauce with the fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes, sliced avocado, and perfectly poached eggs was spot-on!","date":"2018-08-24 01:42:55"}

Half of us were hungover, half of us were starving and all of us were in a rush. We had bachelorette duties to attend to in oh about 1.5-2 hours. The place was really busy and didn't seem possible to get a large party seated and fed within our time frame. Surprisingly enough, we got seated in about 20 minutes. We got right down to ordering and in about 20 more minutes, our food was in front of us ready to be devoured. We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, Eggs Benedict Florentine, Ultimate Skillet, French Toast and of course the Banana Nut Muffin. The portions were huge and the food was tasty. The best part of the brunch was the service. It was very friendly and fast. We got out of there with satisfied tummies and within good time.

One of the most innovative breakfast menu's I've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  Service was outstanding, our waitress, Jessica, was fast and efficient.  \n\nThe feature here is undoubtedly their banana nut muffins.  They were excellent, rivaling the best homemade I've ever tasted.  What amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   They were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  They have a slight gingerbread taste to them so I suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   I know how much work they are to make homemade which is why I really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    The food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with bananas in it.  I feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three banana muffins- mine, my son's, and a free one as a YELP check-in bonus.  I carried two out and enjoyed them later in the day.\n\nI had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  The potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  My son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  A nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the Vegas temps and low humidity.\n\nIt's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in Las Vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip.","date":"2015-10-08 17:44:14"}

I am a coffee drinker and this coffee did not hit the coffee Aficionado spot on my taste buds. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll look you guys up again.","date":"2018-09-25 21:32:33"}

My husband's chile relleno omelet was such a great idea for an omelet...the juicy chile and the cheese tasted amazing wrapped in egg! My benedict's garden (vegetarian version of egg's benedict) was superb as well. Even though one of the items listed in my dish was guacamole, I was SO pleasantly surprised when it arrived NOT as guacamole, but pretty much a whole avocado sliced up!!! You don't get that often, even in California! +10 points for that! The whole combination of poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and avocado was such a delicious creamy mix, and perfectly-balanced by the crisp freshness of the tomatoes. I basically devoured it in under 5 minutes...and then had to wait for the husband to finish his plate *rolls eyes.* We both agreed that their seasoned potatoes were freaking AMAZING. We don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it reminded us of Cajun and it was to die for.

I tried out their waffle plate which came with 2 eggs and a large slice of ham or sausage. The waffle could've been a little warmer, but it tasted wonderful. $2.25 for all you can drink coffee has Starbucks beat.

We arrived at about 11 for a late breakfast and the place was packed. Which is typically a good sign, but it looked borderline at capacity. Moving on, we opted to sit on the patio and it was a great choice! They had misters that added a great touch and I enjoyed people watching! Only tip would be if you don't like pets don't come out here. It's a pet friendly area and in addition to a few dogs Mother Nature's pets attended... there was a fair amount of pigeons. Almost unsanitary because they'd get really close and flap off leaving all sorts of pigeon germs in the air. The restaurant can consider enclosing the area with that garden wood or something that would keep it a bit more sanitary. \n\nMoving on to the food. I felt first off there's way too much going on with the menu. Pictures, eggs , burritos, omelettes, chili, pancakes, and everything is served a thousand ways! I was overwhelmed. Thankfully my baby just learned to read and knew he wanted waffles! I on the other hand ordered half a bacon and avocado omelette and a side of corned beef hash! \n\nAt best, the food was ok. The omelette was well cooked but the amount of avocado was overwhelming, a shock because usually you don't receive enough. The bacon was non existent because of the overwhelming avocado. The hash was mushy. I'd read it in another review and thought impossible, but the flavor was good, but the texture was similar to that of fried stringy mashed potatoes.  I will brag my baby's waffle was delicious, fluffy, and crispy! I'd come back for the waffles and the bacon!","date":"2017-08-29 13:40:28"}

The half portion was like a full portion and I could barely finish it, as it had so much thick sticky cheese on top. Also, the seasoning that they put on the potatoes tastes exactly like Dorritos and I felt like I was eating potato chips (not in a good way). \n\nAlso I just wanted to note something that happened while were waiting for our food to come. The waitress hastily sat us at a 5 top (it was just my bf and I). A family of 5 came in about 10 minutes after us and she tried to sit them in the table next to us which could not accommodate anymore than 4 people. She grabbed a chair from our table to try and seat them there, but the family was really unhappy, it was especially awkward as we were sitting at the only table that could fit them. She then moved them somewhere to the other side of the room. I saw the family leave a few minutes later out of frustration. \n\nThe food is really just standard fare, nothing to write home about.

The banana nut muffin is an option to come with your meal instead of toast and I encourage you to take this offer because it is a sweet, dark, moist muffin that leaves you speechless.

I really didn't want the usual buffet, so we did a quick search on Yelp and off to the Egg and I we went.  \n\nWe stepped in and were quickly seated.  The televisions on the wall was great.  I could see who was playing and not playing for that Sunday's Fantasy Football Lineups.  We ordered coffee and looked over the menu.  (Note- Coffee was ok.  Better than IHOP, but not my favorite blend.) \n\nWe looked over the menu and what a selection!  It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted.  I ordered the Egg-Ceptional Omelet, my wife ordered the Two-egger, and my son had the Chocolate Waffles.    \n\nThe food quickly came out and as far as portions...  they were HUGE!  My wife's Two-egger was like 4 eggs.  My kid's waffles were shaped like Mickey Mouse, which was a nice touch.  My omelet was one of the biggest I've ever seen.  Our only problem was that the chocolate waffle was without chocolate.  We had them bring out some chocolate chips and all was well again.  \n\nThe omelet and ranch spiced potatoes were yummy.  You could taste freshness of the ingredients.  The omelet had sausage, diced ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, portabella mushrooms and melted cheese all topped with sour cream and green onions.     \n\nWe finished all we could and off to gambling we went.","date":"2010-11-28 10:08:00"}

I even got a sweat shirt from here that I wear regularly to the gym in NY LOL. Cute shirt just like the logo. Hubby said that you need your ID to pay at the cashier (if you use your card). The service is one of the best in Vegas. They're fast without rushing you, courteous without over do it, polite and happy naturally. Never had one bad experience. Everything on the menu comes with eggs, what do you expect at \"Egg & I\"? They come with eggs but not with \"U\" of course, we don't eat people. The potato is amazing! I don't like potato but I like this type. It's diced-potato with tasty spice or could be just salt but very tasty. I don't eat much salt but I don't feel that it's salty, just tasty. I've tried different types of omelettes here and thought they're pretty big. Of all the omelette that I ordered so far, I liked Works Vege Omelette and Traditional Omelette. Not a big fan of Chili omelette. Last visit I had just the classic 2 Sunnyside up with toasted English muffin. Had something like this with multigrain before and fruit plate but this time I had it with cottage cheese. Hubby had eggs with potato but usually he would order it with bacon or ham too but I begged hubby to get something without meat for breakfast this time. Whatever you order here is great.

Amazing dessert for sharing.\nThe banana nut muffin that came with the yelp check in had just the right balance of banana, and was moist but firm, great texture that didn't make you feel too heavy after.\nThe veggie eggs Benedict crushed the eggs Benedict game, all the ingredients were fresh and the home fries were perfection. I don't usually like home fries, but these had a special seasoning that was particularly delectable. Also, kudos to Egg&I for having such a great online seating system.

It's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nWe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nOur waitress was Chance and quite honestly one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. She was also VERY attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nFirstly, as I said before, it's busy. But you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. There's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. If the frowny egg is showing, the waitress\/waiter is supposed to help you right away. I never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nFirst thing I loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. You're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) and cream at hand. \nI usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and Chance was eager to help. She told me about the Chile Relleno Benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. Honestly, I'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and I went ahead and ordered it. \nIt was amazing. And it SHOULD be an everyday menu item. I'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nChile Relleno Benedict:\nWow. The dish was amazing. Benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. REALLY well thought out and balanced. First thing I noticed was that the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. The whites were soft but not slimey or runny. There was zero cooked yoke. It was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \nI don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the Chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) chicken breast. The breading was really what made the dish I think. It added just enough saltiness that I didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. I always add salt and pepper (unless I get chicken fried steak) and that was a pleasant surprise. The chile and the chicken were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. There were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly I would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. It was really that good. \nMy GF ordered the veggie pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. I didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. I DID sneak a few fries however and loved them. Thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. Another instance where salt was not necessary. Really they would have been fine without ketchup. \nI fully intend on visiting this place every time I head to Las Vegas and can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you Egg & I for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!","date":"2014-11-13 22:25:56"}

If you want to avoid long lines or expensive buffets, this is a great local alternative. Be prepared to wait in line! There is usually some time of wait in the morning to brunch. I would definitely recommend trying to get there as early as possible. When I first walked in, I thought...hmm this looks like a glorified Denny's. However, the painting on the wall was cute but the the rest of the restaurant was a bit dated in decor. However, it was easy to ignore all of that and realize that every seat was packed with a combination of locals and visitors to the great city of Las Vegas. \n\nBeing a more health conscious eater, I ordered a egg white veggie omelette. My husband ordered the combination of eggs over easy and banana nut pancakes. Both were excellent, high quality ingredients and well made. The best part was getting the bill which was just a little over $20. That amount would barely cover one person's entrance into a mediocre Vegas strip brunch buffet.","date":"2014-01-20 05:04:59"}

I can't really agree with that but it's pretty darn good.  I ordered the corned beef hash and what came wasn't your standard canned mushed beef stuff. There were real pieces of corned beef in this mixed with potatoes, onions, red, green peepers and topped with 2 eggs of your choice, which should always be over easy eggs with super sloppy running yolks. The flavors were spot on and the side of potatoes were nice.  The banana muffin that is served is awesome too.  It's probably microwaved before getting to your table but it's still very decent.  Prices are a little bit high like $10.95 for the hash and the wait can be long.  The annoying thing about this place is paying at the cashier!

Came across this place so I took my family and brother here. I went in to place my name on the list and went for first available meaning we might be seated outside. It looked okay since they had mists going on and it was pretty shaded. My brother didn't think it was a good idea so I went back and they had no problem noting we wanted to sit inside. It's busy but people go in and out quick. We waited for about 5-10mins. \nAs usual we got seated, got menus and they asked for what drinks we wanted. So far so good with service with Amanda. She took our orders and talked a little to my 1 1\/2 year old niece. Drinks came out quick. The banana nut muffin that came with our meal came out as well and it was so delish!!! My daughter and I got one each and we saved one for later. We didn't want to get full so we shared one. \nOur food came out. I had the corn beef hash with the side of potatoes. Potatoes were good. I don't know why I got the corn beef. I'm not really a fan of it but it got a lot of reviews. My daughter ate half of her omelette and saw a hair in it. We bothered one of the servers about it and she took it back and made my daughter a half order of the same omelette. Almost done with our meal, they forgot to t bring out the banana pancakes my bro ordered. We reminded them about it too. \nThe lady that took back the omelette came out with a complimentary plate of these banana bread with custard filling goodness. She probably gave it to us because of my daughters omelette and forgetting the pancakes on time. Omg! It melts in your mouth!! \nI love this place and they have the best customer service. Especially when it's crazy busy in there. When they brought out the pancakes, they told us they did not charge us for the omelette and pancakes. How awesome is that?? \nThey're super nice!

We decided to check this place out after reading the glowing reviews on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.\n\nWe arrived around 10:15am on a Sunday and the place was packed! There was a line outside the door of people waiting. However, the wait was quite fast and our party of 6 was seated in about 20 min. The service was excellent - our waitress Alexa was super friendly and took our complicated drink and food orders with ease. Any one with a Yelp account can also check in to receive a free banana nut muffin, which was huge, warm, and full of banana flavor. It was one of the best banana nut muffins I have tasted. In addition, coffee comes with unlimited refills! \n\nOur table ordered:\nBacon and sliced avocado omelette ($11.25): excellent. The omelette was huge and stuffed with ample chunks of whole avocado, bacon bits, and topped with a generous amount of melted Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. There was also a side of buttered toast and a choice of home fries, cottage cheese, or fruit (I think this is offered with any egg dish). Delicious, and a large portion size for one person. \nHeart stopper skillet special ($10.25): this was my favorite dish that our table ordered. It was one of the specials and consisted of a layer of works potatoes topped with bacon, ham, and sausage and smothered in homemade country style gravy and two sunny-side up eggs. The gravy and the runny egg yolks mixed with the potatoes and meat created a delicious creamy explosion of flavor and umami. \nSouthwestern Cobb salad ($10.50): a huge salad with a ton of toppings. I was impressed that there was very little lettuce, and instead a lot of delicious toppings such as taco seasoned chicken, black bean and corn relish, tomatoes, black olives, bacon, cheddar cheese, tortilla strips, and a whole sliced avocado (amazing!) with chipotle ranch dressing. \nSundance special omelette ($11.25): veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Swiss cheese topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. You can also add chicken for an extra $2.50. The feta cheese melded perfectly with the creamy egg flavor and the various vegetables. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place for brunch.

I had the coffee too, and the waitress was never stingy when more creamers were requested.  Such good service.  I can see why this place has people waiting for a seat.\n\nThis place has the best egg-dish menu I've ever seen.  The price of most dishes is in the $10.00 or less range.  They have plasma TV's strategically placed on walls, so you can watch sports if the conversation crashes.  It's all good. This is the best non-buffet breakfast I've had in Las Vegas.","date":"2011-07-01 16:11:57"}

It seemed to be really busy with lots of people waiting outside (on a Sunday afternoon), but we luckily only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated.  \n\nOur server was super nice.  She really helped elevate the entire experience.  When we asked for banana nut muffins to go with our entrees, she asked if it was our first time there.  We told her yes and she said the muffins were free for first timers!  Hope that's true and I'm not getting anyone in trouble by posting that info here.  \n\nI ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine & it came with those little (obviously frozen) and highly seasoned potatoes.  Overall I enjoyed the dish, but there was so much Hollandaise sauce that the English muffin got pretty soggy and the ham was really quite bad.  It was cut in thick slices and was very rubbery.  It almost tasted canned or something.  I took the ham off and it was much better that way.  However, the whole thing was a runny, saucy mess.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly though.  My sister unfortunately didn't enjoy her blueberry pancakes too much.  This might sound strange, but they were way too fluffy for both of us & just didn't taste that great.  We both loved the muffins though.  That very well may have been the best part of the whole meal.  \n\nDespite the rubbery ham, I'd definitely come back.  The service was excellent and I feel confident that we'll both be able to find other dishes on the menu that suit us better.  Plus.... those banana nut muffins!  You'd be a fool not to try one.","date":"2011-05-31 15:04:31"}

Food came but no forks to eat it with. I got the veggie Benny. Too much lemon in the hollandaise. Probably would have been great with the crabcakes. My daughter got the buttermilk pancakes. Chewy?  And they said that can happen when you add syrup. Really? Doesn't happen at I HOP. The manager was very concerned we didn't like our meal and took off the pancakes since they weren't eaten.

Unfortunately everyone thought the same thing too. It was bumpin' in here but the waitresses were hauling ASS to get everyone in. Jaime and I waited about 10 minutes before being seated, but it was well worth the wait. \n\nFirst off: check in offer is a banana nut muffin. When it came to the table it was warm and oh my god, so good.  It's gotta be made with some sort of whole wheat or bran flour cuz it's a dark looking muffin.  It's so moist (sorry, had to do it) and dense yet light, sweet but not too much, and just literally the perfect muffin.  \n\nI asked our waitress, Karla, for some coffee and I was treated to my own thermos of it, score! There's a little egg symbol on the table that once it's switched to the other color it signifies that the table needs attending to. Jaime wanted an ice tea refill and flipped the egg over. Within seconds another waitress (Karla was busy) was at our table to help.  What a great team!\n\nI ordered the Veggie Eggs Benny and was so pleased with it! It's two poached eggs on top of a split english muffin, with grilled tomatoes, avocado, and spinach.  The best though was dipping those seasoned potatoes into the hollandaise sauce. They're fried and perfect to dip into a yolk too. \n\nYou won't leave here hungry, that's for sure!","date":"2017-03-29 01:22:25"}

Call ahead and ask if there is a wait just because when we got there, there was quite a line.

They have a lot of options and vegetarians too so check out the menu! \n\nPrice is about comparable to Denny's or IHOP. \n\nI ordered chile relleno omelet with banana but bread and the hubby got 'the works,' with toast. We enjoyed our food and both finished it in no time. \n\nWill definitely come back. \n\nOur server Erin is very upbeat and personable, made our dining experience a little extra special!","date":"2014-05-12 02:43:27"}

Who'd dont Live Banana Nut??\n\n\nI cant wait to come back. I'm here from California, San Diego to be exact. Slid out here for the MAGIC convention. Whenever I hot anywhere I like to eat where the Locals do. With Vegas Being Vegas for the most part it's always some kinda tourist type dining experience. I didnt look at pics or nothin so I was kinda bummed I didnt order the Stuffed French Toast (I was checking in and seen a picture. My wife Yelp'd the spot). I ended up getting the \"Sunrise Mountain\" not sure But our Server Tamara said it was \"Really good\". I also want to add that Tamara is A-1 like the Steak Sauce. I overheard her talking to another table offering suggestions, without prompt. See, I dont eat like the average person so I no longer ask for suggestions. That's Dope cause I be places where servers be on some other shit. Not looking. Don't want to talk, really. We're  in a time where most establishments show it's the money not the people. I'm all about Love in Business (Being a small Business owner) cause it shows appreciation to the customer base. Anyway, shes Lovely, made us feel welcomed and comfortable. I just be rambling a lot cause i be having alot I want to get out. Who knows the next time you and I will ever Interact?? If you ever looking for good eats in Vegas I highly recommend this place.

No problem, you get a warm banana nut muffin. Regular, check in with yelp and get a free muffin. Lots to choose from. The portions are big enough that you can share with someone else.  Shane was our waiter ABC be was so nice! He recommended the rib eye benedict. So good!  It comes with home potatoes that are seasoned to perfection. The Mexican Crepe (made out of eggs) is pretty good to.  My boyfriend and I shared the rib eye benedict and the biscuits and gravy. Come on an empty stomach, trust me.

Until I found this place (and others) on Yelp, we used to just have breakfast\/brunch in the hotel's anonymous coffee shop.  Meh.\n\n Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.\n\nTo be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.\n\nIf you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.\n\nThere are fine dinner restaurants off the Strip as well!  Yelp is here for you.","date":"2012-12-06 07:25:02"}

Perfect. \nThe pumpkin pancakes were moist (which I didn't expect, usually they are dry dry dry) but they were really good, like a good pumpkin cake (not pie).. \nAnd the Rellenos were really good, not too much cheese (which I don't like) and he really enjoyed them.\nAll in all a really good meal! \nIt's 3PM and I'm still not hungry..\nOh, and we tried the Banana Muffins.. we gobbled them up! \nEven the coffee was OK.. \nDefinitely, will be heading back for more!","date":"2014-04-23 22:14:35"}

No accounting for taste....\n\nWe had the tuna melt, the Sundance Special, and the flavored coffee (partner's idea). The Sundance Special, a veggie omelet with thought behind it, was actually pretty yummy (artichoke, feta, spinach...great flavors), but the potatoes that come with were pretty yucky. Just cubed potatoes that are overly seasoned and taste previously frozen, not that fresh.\n\nThe tuna melt was the WORST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. SOOOOO BAD! The \"cheese\" looked like a non-melting version of Velveeta. I'm not sure it was real. I had to scrape it off; it was disgusting. Also the tuna salad part was the worst tuna salad ever. It was a mushy, wet, flavorless glob of mayonnaise mess. The Parmesan bread it comes on is super-salty. The matchstick fries it comes with don't taste that fresh and are overly spiced.\n\nI picked the sandwich to pieces, and most pieces remained on my plate. I ate my partner's Sundance Special, because Vegas portion sizes allow for that. The server didn't even bother to ask how our food was, just slapped the check down and didn't comment that I had barely touched my plate.\n\nThe flavored coffee (hazelnut) is really gross. Bad idea to order it, but it tastes like the bad idea it is--overly sweet with its sweetness covering up that burnt taste that most diner coffee has.\n\nThis is the kind of place that automatically brings straws with water and gives you styrofoam for your leftovers.","date":"2014-12-18 06:29:09"}

I was told the wait was about 15 minutes; I waited a solid 20 (which isn't bad when \"15 minutes\" usually serves as code for half-an-hour) and was promptly greeted by my wonderful server. I had my food about 10 minutes after I placed my order.\n\nMy late uncle was a gourmet chef, and my earliest, fondest memories of Vegas revolve around eating his cooking. Biscuits and gravy were on the usual menu when my family and I made our annual road trip out here, and I have purposely shied away from ever ordering it because nothing could ever come close.\n\nBut, for some reason, I ordered it anyway here. Was it as good as my Uncle Ray's? \n\nDoes the free show in front TI have anything to do with pirates anymore?\n\nExactly. But that said, I would probably order it again. I regret not remembering my server's name, but she's one of the best I've had in a LONG time, and as someone that waited tables and bartended her way through school, my standards of service are ridiculously high. She was awesome, and was warmer, more attentive and professional than any server I've had elsewhere in Vegas, even in those pretentious \"five-star\" restaurants you'll find in abundance in this city.\n\nKeep in mind they're open from 6 am - 3 pm. I was told by a girl at the host desk that the best time to go was 6-8 and after 1:30.\n\nOverall value?\n\nPrice: 3.5\nService: 5\nAmbiance: 4\n\n= 4.17. But Yelp! doesn't offer a decimal rating. So a solid four stars from me. Worth visiting at least once if you want a tasty meal in a casual atmosphere without the pretentious attitude.","date":"2012-07-02 02:54:36"}

First of all, their service is amazing. We called ahead to see our wait time and they offered to put our name down, so by the time we arrived half an hour later, our tables was all ready for a group of 15 --perfect! Our server was also super sweet and constantly checked on us while even offering everyone in the table a free banana nut muffin. I did claim the Yelp check-in for the free muffin, but she was kind enough to just give everyone in our table one. What was even more wonderful was that one of our party members is allergic to nuts, so they gave her a blueberry muffin in replacement.\n\nFor food, I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Skillet with sourdough toast ($10.25). I also shared with the boyfriend as he got the Stuffed French Toast ($9.75). When you're ordering here, I know your eyes are going to speak louder than your stomach, but I can guarantee that you'll be stuffed by the end of the meal. I highly recommend the Stuffed French Toast. It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet with a sausage, cheese and egg mixture folded between french toast. The syrup it comes with is lightly sweet and simply tastes amazing altogether. Of course, you'll end up a little sticky but it's worth the battle. Their potatoes are no ordinary potatoes either. They give you a plate full of potatoes covered with cajun seasoning --so delicious! Not to forget the skillet I ordered, because that was very tasty as well. They melted so much cheese over my potatoes, which was my favorite part. I only had 1\/4 of the skillet and was too full to continue.\n\nWhen paying, we always struggle with a huge group. They have you pay up front and were very patient to help us easily sort each order and pay efficiently. The service and food is seriously on par here, love it.","date":"2016-02-01 23:37:11"}

We were looking for a place to have a good breakfast before heading out on the road back to Phoenix.  We had been in Vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  I found the Egg & I using my awesome Yelp iPhone app.  Everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both Egg & I and to Yelp at the end of the meal.\n\nThe special of the day was the Prime Rib Skillet, Prime Rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  Two people at our table of six went for the special.  Other meals included a Brad's Scramble, two Chicken Fried Steak Skillets, and mine was the Kay's Omelette (Four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic and cream cheese. Topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  Everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.\n\nOne friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  She started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  Very nice customer service.  My friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.\n\nThe standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  These are the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had, and I love breakfast potatoes!  The seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.\n\nThere are plenty of great reviews for this place, so I don't need to go on and on.  Just one more final thought.  When I am coming home from a trip I always like to look back and think about what I learned during the trip.  On this trip, I learned a few things . . .\n\n1 - Don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of Guinness, chances are it may fall in.\n2 - Cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  Even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again.\n3 - Add the Egg & I to the \"must-have\" list anytime I'm in Vegas!","date":"2010-03-22 02:53:29"}

After looking up a few places, ie. Denny's, Hash House a Go Go, we decided to come here even though it's off the strip. We took a Lyft from Venetian and the ride was only $11. \n\nWith a party of 10, we thought that the wait would be around an hour, hour and a half, but amazingly, it was only thirty minutes. If you are coming here though, expect a long wait, so be patient, but it's worth the wait! Once we got seated, they handed us menus which looks like a daily newspaper. Deciding what to eat here was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make since there are 8 pages of food to read. Took a while but I finally decided on the Santa Cruz Skillet. \n\nSanta Cruz Skillet: The order came with toast and butter (since I got the muffin with the check-in) and sunny-side up eggs. The potatoes, chorizo, Santa Cruz sauce and the runny yolk was probably the best breakfast you could ask for after a night of drinking. Portion-wise, you could easily share this with another person but I was able to finish it on my own. \n\nService was amazing throughout the meal, they have a system where you flip the happy egg to a sad egg whenever you need something, genius! I would have subtracted a star for them bringing out the 2 Bloody Mary's and Michelada after we almost finished the food, but they didn't charge us for the drinks in the end. On top of that, 7 of us checked-in for the free Banana Nut Muffin. I can't stress this enough, don't forget to check in! Will be back here for sure to try the other items on the menu. \n\nBeware: You will get a food coma after eating here, we all ended up taking a nap in the room afterwards, but once again, soo worth it!","date":"2016-02-25 17:25:48"}

I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about. \n\nAnd I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life.

The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right. \n\nWhen we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill.

My other favorite was the veggie skillet, we did low-sodium for that and it was just perfect! It was the best out of all the dishes. However, the CFS skillet was a bit too salty for our tastes and the huevos rancheros was just ok. Portions were more than enough and price-wise it's more on the affordable side when you think of LV breakfasts for just under and over $10.\n\nOverall honestly this place isn't above average compared to other breakfast places in LV, just ok.","date":"2018-07-09 17:29:32"}

We came in on a late Sunday morning for breakfast. We didn't know we should have called ahead to be placed on \"the list\". So our estimated wait time for amy seating for 2 was 45 minutes. We gave our info and waited for our turn to be seated. \nWe observed the hostess be informed several times there were multiple open tables for 2, 3, or 4 guests. Yet she didn't send messages to the waiting customers until she was told by multiple people several times about the open tables. \nAfter we were seated our server was good. She gave us enough time to look at the menu and place our orders.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and I had a savory crepe (I don't know the name). Our food came out fairly quickly for how busy the place was. Husband said his food was great. Mine was okay. I was thinking the turkey was going to be cubed not shredded. The guacamole inside the crepe was good. The spicy potato cubes that came on the side were good.  Only real bummer about the service was that the bloody Mary I ordered never came out. Our server realized this about the time I was finishing my food. \nOverall this was a cute fun place to go. Totally recommend calling to get on the list if you plan to visit on a weekend.

Yes there were people waiting outside to eat due to this place being so popular for breakfast.  The wait was 15 minutes which wasn't that bad.  I tried the waffle works, which consisted of a huge Belgian waffle with 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs.  I did request whipped cream on the waffle, which made it taste even better.  The waffle was huge.  I enjoyed every bite.  The portions were very generous for the price.  Worth every penny.  The server Lindsey was wonderful and made sure I had the meal of a lifetime.  \n\n     The Egg and I taught me a lesson that the best places to eat are not always on the Strip or Downtown Las Vegas.  There are good places to eat all over Las Vegas and you have to dig deep into your soul for the best food possible.  The Egg and I has a small town feel to it which provides an intimate dining experience.  This is one of the few places in Las Vegas you can eat at everyday and not get tired of it but wouldn't do so simply due to the fact that you don't want to spoil yourself.  This will become my new go-to spot in need of a good breakfast while visiting.  As far as the food quality and atmosphere goes. the Egg and I destroys Denny's and IHOP by all leaps and bounds imaginable.","date":"2014-10-14 04:40:44"}

Portion size and price mean very little if the food is not worth talking about. This was breakfast heaven. The wait staff was outstanding (ask for Sam if she's there), the service was prompt, the portions were plentiful, the price was appropriate for the size of the portions and the food was absolutely phenomenal. Get the banana nut muffin whether it's included or not. It was so good, it tasted like a dessert. To add butter or anything else to it would be a crime, it was perfect the way it was. My wife had waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Typically, she does not eat large portion meals without sliding some of it across the table to me. She polished off the whole thing. I had some kind of special that came with four scrambled eggs mixed with bacon, spinach, mushrooms and loads of cheese and some kind of side of potatoes that was eye-rolling awesome. I've been on this planet for over half a century and I honestly don't remember the last time I had a breakfast that tasted this good from start to finish. According to Sam, everything on the menu can be modified or customized to taste and size. This place is almost a reason to go to Vegas if for no other reason. I highly recommend it.","date":"2011-08-04 01:26:59"}

I've driven by this place multiple times and it's caught my attention a few time while in the same plaza as B&C Camera. \n\nThey have a diverse menu of egg related items. I was about to order one of the combo skillets because another table's home fries looked GOOD but ended up getting a Hawaiian themed plate which featured Portuguese Sasuage or Spam (went for the sausage), rice, two eggs any style (sunny side up), \"sticky\" rice (turned out to be calrose rice). Also came with a choice of what ever bread or the banana nut muffin everyone raves about. \n\nI choose the muffin and man oh man it did not disappoint. Blueberry's always been my favorite muffin and to be honest i havent eaten enough muffins in my life time. If i were in a situation where the entire fate of humanity rested upon my recommendation for a muffin it would be The Egg & I's banana nut hands own, sorry humanity you had your chance i'm throwing this one out and if it lands under the bus so be it. \n\nOverall the island favorite plate was good, obviously the Portuguese sausage made the dish but in all honesty it wasnt worth the price. Even with the banana nut muffin dreams are made of it still wasnt quite worth it. For the same price my buddy got one of the combo skillets and he ended up easily with three times more food then i did.\n\nSo far i do like this place. Outdoor seating was available immediately seeing as it was a cold morning but their heaters are very powerful and aside from a few gusts of wind there was very little outdoor discomfort. Looking at other people's plate was very easy on the eyes as their selection of food is diverse yet seeing common dishes amongst different diners makes me want to come back and get what they're getting because they cant all be wrong.","date":"2012-11-11 08:44:38"}

When I go on trips that involve Vegas, I've started planning the itinerary to let me go to Eggs & I for breakfast. It is a slight trek from the strip, but totally worth it.\n\nFor my most recent visit I got the Ensenada Burrito and my wife got the Banana Bread French Toast. The Ensenada Burrito was a recommendation from my server Amanda and I'm so glad I listened to her. The burrito was delicious. Tasty meat and eggs in the burrito and topped with a healthy amount of cheese. Plus, it came with a side of their potatoes (what they call habla diablo seasoned potatoes) which are some of my favorite breakfast potatoes. So good. My wife's french toast was sweet and delicious. The service was top notch. Amanda (our server) was cheerful and seemed genuinely excited to help us figure out what to eat.\n\nOh, and they have this black\/yellow egg heads on each table to notify the staff if you need help (Black smiley face = you're ok, Yellow frowny face = need assistant). The staff watches this like hawks. Each time we flipped it, a staff member (not just your server) is right there to help. We were in a rush and needed the check... flipped it... 5 seconds later a staff member was there... 30 seconds later our server gave us our check. It was awesome.\n\nOverall, I can't say enough about this place. It is one of the best breakfast places in Vegas (if not THE best). The wait is quick, the service is great, and the food is top notch.","date":"2015-08-23 05:09:54"}

Immediately you will notice a group of people waiting patiently outside of the restaurant for the next available seat. When I go, being a smoker, I usually go out on the patio to enjoy the fresh air and a smoke with my coffee and book. The staff is so welcoming. I am a frequent visitor so they know where I would like to sit, escort me to a table of my choosing, provide an ashtray, and offer the heating lamp if it is cold outside. Always friendly, you are not just communicated with by your server, but others in the staff that notice your presence. Nobody walks around with blinders on. You feel as if they are there to enjoy your breakfast with you. \n\nSpeaking of the breakfast; it is the best in town! The wait is never long, and the food is always fresh and hot. Makes one wonder what kind of army is stacked away in the kitchen. Spinning out plate after plate of unique dishes that dont only taste great, but are piled high on your plate, makes me want to walk into the kitchen and give its staff a huge hug. There is something on the menu for everyone's taste, and, unlike many chain breakfast places who will remain unnamed, you actually get fresh ingredients, and flavor without frou frou toppings of berries and whip cream to try and doll it up. I find myself looking at others plates and wondering what they are having with delicious anticipation of trying it the next time. My signature dish is Brads Special, and I almost never stray from a favorite, but the fact that I feel safe to do so at The Egg and I says a lot.\n\nA pleasant \"hello how are you\" greets you at the door, and a friendly \"Thank you, have a nice day\" assures a future visit. If The Egg and I added a few floors atop its building, and offered rooms like a Bed and Breakfast, you better believe there would never be an available occupancy.","date":"2011-02-20 20:34:00"}

So I said - well, we won't need the other muffin, but the waitress said - no charge! - I'll bring you an extra anyway.\n\nThe food was excellent. The breakfast potatoes need some work - they were just hard fried \"bits\" of potatoes - but everything else was great.

We had to drop by the airport and chose Eggs & I as our go-to food spot afterwards.\n\nThe menu consists of a variety of eggs benedict dishes, omelettes, hash, and other breakfast items.\n\nService is homey and the vibe is definitely casual here.  The menu comes out printed on newspaper stock so perhaps their items change frequently.\n\nWe started out with their signature banana nut muffin which accompanies many of their dishes.  Light, soft, fluffy, and not too sweet, the banana nut bread was a hit and a great starter.\n\nOur entrees included a mish-mash of their popular dishes:\n\nPrime Rib Benny (or Benedict) - the highlight dish entree was an Eggs Benedict version made up of prime rib.  It replaces the traditional muffin with a croissant and is definitely a large portion so was plenty to share.\n\nFlorentine Benedict - a version made with spinach and ham.  Pretty good.\n\nChicken Fried steak - I only had a few bites, but I liked it.  It's a calorie killer though.\n\nKay's Omelette - another signatuer omelette, it had plentiful cheese, ham, and egg.  Kinda plain and not sure why this is so popular.  You could make similar omelettes at home.\n\nBrad's Chili - wasn't sure which chili to order and was recommended this one.  It came out lukewarm, had a bland flavor and was generally forgetabble. \n\nEggs & I is a decent brunch spot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  They take credit cards, including American Express.","date":"2010-10-14 19:52:14"}

It was pretty busy for 11:00 on a Thursday.  \n\nFacility:  fairly good size place with a dinner atmosphere. There were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too. \n\nService:  not the best service I ever had, but not the worst. Doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing. It took a good 10 minutes before someone took my drink order, we had to flag someone a few times, and after the food came, no one did the check back to make sure we didn't need anything else....but when they did help us, they were friendly and quick. \n\nFood:  a girlfriend and I decided to split two meals, so we could try more.  We ordered the \"Chili Relleno Eggs Benedict\" special, and we got the \"chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and banana nut muffin.\"  \nThe muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  Would have been perfect if they served some butter with it. \nThe Benedict was good. I love the chili taste that cut the richness of the Benedict. \nThe chicken fried steak was good, but not the best I ever had. It was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. I really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  When they first came out, I thought I wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.  However, they actually had just the right amount, and it had a Lawrys season salt flavor. \n\nOverall:  I would definitely come back here again. They have so many good things in the menu I want to try.  See yah soon!!","date":"2015-01-23 07:16:22"}

That was changed today.\n\nWe were seated promptly and were served coffee and water promptly while we looked through their extensive menu done in the form of a tabloid newspaper.\n\nI got the Benedict's Garden, a vegetarian Eggs Benedict.  It came with English muffin halves on the bottom, then sliced grilled tomatoes, some avocado, and topped (the menu says smothered which is close) with Hollandaise.  There were potatoes and a side of some fresh fruit.  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was the special of the day.\n\nEverything was really good.  My eggs and the mixture of avocado and tomato with the Hollandaise was quite good.  The breakfast potatoes were really flavorful and the small slice of canteloupe and fresh pineapple was like having a dessert at breakfast.  My friend thought his omelette was one of the best he has had.  Be prepared for a large breakfast.  The omelettes are listed as four eggs.\n\nWe chatted and passed a considerable amount of time.

The coffee was also piping hot and strong.  The service was ok, it took two tries to get glasses of water.  And yes I did try the banana nut muffin as others indicated and it was awesome with butter, only minus was the size, needs to be bigger!  I so wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the potatoes, here they fail because they have cut them it small cubes and they are hard but the worst part is the seasoning on them, super salty.

Since we're at a timeshare I'm enjoying making breakfast most of the week.  On a lark I decide we're going out, and I google \"best las vegas breakfast\".  #1 on the list is \"The Egg and I\".  So we map it and off we go, without a lot of expectations or knowing what's on the menu.  \n\nSo first of all there's a bit of a wait - 15-20 minutes for a table.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, and every table is filled.  We are seated outdoors on the patio and there are heaters set up (the stand-up propane ones) every couple of tables so we're nice and cozy.\n\nCoffee comes and guess what - it's really good.  I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic - I roast my own beans at home and can distinguish varietals between African and South American by taste - and it's surprisingly lively on the palette for a breakfast joint.\n\nBetween the four of us, we order a vegan breakfast, two different omelets and biscuits and gravy.  Each entry is under $10, and the portions are absolutely ginormous.  It's a quarter to midnight and I'm still stuffed.  \n\nBut most importantly, every thing on the plate is absolutely delicious.  From the specialty omelets to the potatoes to the gravy, everything is simply first rate.  \n\nApparently the place has won several awards and is Zagat rated.  I have no reason to doubt any of this - if you're in Las Vegas for breakfast, you absolutely MUST search out and try The Egg and I.","date":"2011-01-16 07:48:13"}

I was told I could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. This is the first time I have run into this problem. She also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register.

I think we beat the mad rush on a Friday morning by coming on the early side around 8AM. By the time we left nearing 10AM, there was a line out the door. Service was friendly and attentive. I was pretty disappointed with the food though. We ordered a veggie eggs benedict and a southwest (chicken\/chorizo) hash. At first, the order for the eggs benedict came out wrong with canadian bacon and spinach vs. just all veggie. The waitress brought out extra banana nut muffins to apologize, which was a nice gesture especially since the best thing here was the banana nut muffin.  The hollandaise on the benedict was really watery and had a slight sweet taste to it. Overall, the benedict lacked flavor. On the other hand, the hash and the breakfast potatoes were extremely salty. We got the extremes here in terms of flavor (too salty and too bland). Overall, not bad, not great.","date":"2017-05-16 14:24:54"}

On top of that was a layer of melted cheese and two eggs over-easy.  The skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  It was pretty tasty.  I really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.\n\nThere were three different types of Habla Diablo sauce on the table Original, Chipotle, and Verde.

This was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the Vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  Here's the best recommendation I can give about the food: I came back for breakfast the next day!  And we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nWe got off to a good start.  When the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm banana nut muffin to try.  It's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nWhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words Habla Diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  My wife wanted the Spinach Benny, but was concerned about the Habla Diablo potatoes because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  The waitress explained that it wasn't spicy at all, that Habla Diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  My wife went ahead with her spinach benny and I got the loco moco, with an extra side of the Habla Diablo potatoes.  (It turns out that the Habla Diablo seasoning is a lot like Lawry's Seasoned Salt.)\n\nMy wife really liked her spinach benny, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (But she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  I liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  Plus the loco moco was the best I've had on the mainland!\n\nThe next day, I came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  This time I had the Biscuits & Gravy, which were great.  But, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   Then I picked out the California Crepe for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  I asked to substitute some fruit for the Habla Diablo potatoes, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  My wife loved the California Crepe, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!","date":"2015-07-30 18:47:11"}

I really liked their breakfast potatoes as well as they were season with extra season and were better than I expected.  The eggs are eggs and nothing special there.

Don't get me wrong, those are good. However, if you are looking for something a little off the beaten path for the BEST spot for breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further because the \"Egg and I\" will have you covered. With an astounding 2,500 reviews (as of October), its no wonder why this place has near-perfect Yelp reviews. \n\nI've actually had this place bookmarked forever as I finally got the opportunity to dine here with my lady on the morning of Saturday 9\/30\/17. Located directly on West Sahara Ave. (and adjacent to Arville St.), Egg and I is located in the Westside neighborhood of Las Vegas and only about a 10 minute drive from the Strip. Parking especially during breakfast hours can be very challenging as there are other business here. But the majority of people the park in this lot dine here.\n\nSince we had arrived around 10:45am, we park quite a distance from the main entrance. The exterior is very rustic and looks like your mom & pop place. The interior has a very cozy and charming feel to it. Since the weather was a perfect 76°, we decided on dining at their generous outdoor patio. Since I was still tired (after not crashing until 3:30am and waking up at 7:30am), I ordered coffee. What is nice is that they give me the entire carafe of coffee! And lots of liquid creamers to go with it. Score! And our server was very sweet, attentive, and took care of us in a timely manner.\n\nTheir menu is very extensive; they have a huge variety of Eggs Benedicts, omelettes, corned beef hash, French toast, pancakes, waffles, and crepes. I finally decide on ordering their \"Bacon & Onion Skillet\" (for $9.99). My lady opted for \"The Classic\" which are two-eggs (she chose over easy) w\/toast and Godshall's turkey bacon. Both of us receive their signature Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. Even though business was at full capacity, both our breakfast platters arrive in just 10 minutes.\n\nI've got to say, I was very impressed with what I received. There is something magical about these potatoes because the seasoning in them was addictive! And the bed of eggs over the ooey-gooey cheese made every savory bite a heavenly experience. I had the opportunity of trying some of her turkey bacon and damn, this was flavorful and on point! For the price you pay, you will get enough food to carry you through the rest of the day. In fact, my next meal wasn't until around 8 hours later at 7:30pm.\n\nA little added bonus, if you check-in on the Yelp app, they will give you their signature Banana Nut Muffin. However, we got so much food that even more carbohydrates with that muffin would equal a massive food coma. Overall, the \"Egg and I\" is definitely a place worth checking out. A great family-owned experience, quality food, excellent prices, and stellar service makes this one of the easiest five-star ratings I've given in quite some time!","date":"2017-10-07 03:16:18"}

Husband ordered the hash skillet it was amazing, like, mouthgasm amazing. When it came to the table it didn't look like it was going to be that good, but wow. I ordered a chicken fried steak breakfast with over easy eggs, gravy was portioned well, not overly done, steak fried perfectly, not greasy, but crispy even with the layer of gravy. Their potatoes are pretty interesting diced\/cubed with like a season salt, have a nice crunch to them. The portion sizes here are absurdly large, I think we could've easily shared one of these breakfasts plates and been satisfied. We both weren't able to finish either plate. They also come with a side of toast or a muffin. Only downside I'd say is the coffee price is a bit on the steep side, but they do leave you a jug, at your table so you don't need to flag someone down and you're supplied with all your needs at your table.","date":"2015-06-11 03:51:13"}

The Egg & I is largely an antithesis to what \"Vegas\" stands for. It is low key, low on panache, and reasonably priced.\n\nI've been here now a couple of times, all in the winter and early spring months, which means I'm always on the patio, because for me 70 + degrees is perfect patio weather. The inside does seem a little bit packed for my taste, regardless of what time they're open. On the weekends, you'd be hard pressed to find a time when it's not poppin here. But that's okay, I assure you it's worth the wait.\n\nThe menu is expansive. I'm talking, there is something for everyone. Hashes, Omelettes, Scrambles, Sweets, Benedict, even some rogue brunch items which are surprisingly good in their own right. But by and large, breakfast here is the way to go. Anything with their namesake, eggs, is an automatic winner. Portions are on the larger side, but not obscenely so. You're going to walk away full, but not sickly so, which is the perfect storm breakfast in my eyes. If you're a coffee fan like myself, it flows freely here and is pretty damn good. Overall, I really like this place and would recommend it for locals and tourists alike.\n\nOther benefits include: parking situation is easy to navigate, food itself is reasonably priced. \n\n*Takes all major credit cards, except American Express.","date":"2018-03-06 19:51:08"}

The menu is huge and appealing that none of us could make up our minds on what to order. Eventually we did, 2 friends got the eggs Benedict and pancakes, another got the steak and eggs with rice and I got the spinach and avocado omelet with fruits and I shared the strawberry creme french toast with a friend. The ambiance is like any ordinary breakfast joint with that \"home\" and \"granny's house\" feeling. \n\nEveryone loved their foods, but it was so much that they couldn't finish it except for my friend who got the steak and eggs. I for one cold not even eat half of my food, regardless of how delicious it is....and I can eat a whole lot. I loved that my omelet was full of fresh huge slices of avocado and spinach inside my omelet. The fruits were fairly fresh and sweet. My whole plate cost me about $118 with tip so not bad considering I had a yummy Easter omelet, fruits and a huge delicious stack of french toast. Sadly, none of us took our food to go because we were on the road doing errands that day. \n\nNext time I hit up Vegas, I'll be sure to come here for breakfast!","date":"2013-04-19 21:15:12"}

But she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but I declined.   My other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  \n\nThe food and service was great and I would have def gone back but my intentions while I was in Vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  \n\nThey don't take American Express, not sure if it's just at this location. \n\nThank you Carole Ann for great customer service, keep it up and I hope you get to meet Mickey Mouse!!!","date":"2014-06-16 04:21:29"}

Every time I'm here, while the service is great and friendly, the place is just packed and I find the breakfast to be lackluster, compared to Egg Works.\n\nThe seating is pretty crammed, even when you get there early. We're often bumped by servers and patrons as they're making their way to tables.\n\nI also don't love how they *only* have those season-salty potatoes and not fresh hashbrowns. They have them, but only those frozen hashbrown patties. Meh. I like homestyle potatoes, but these really seem like they're dumped out of an Ore-Ida bag.\n\nThe last time we went, I asked for my poached eggs well in my eggs benedict and they came back *very* runny both times. I can handle a little runny, but these were like, runny to the point of being almost chilly inside the yolk.  It's a texture thing and it skeeves me. I know I'm not the only one. \n\nThey were really great when I sent it back the first time, but the second time, I felt like a total pain in the ass and was embarrassed having to ask them to redo it, even though it wasn't my fault. They were gracious and took it off our bill and the 2nd time they made it, the eggs were cooked well enough. (Yes, we tipped on the full cost of the bill.) \n\nI also am not wild about how they completely drown their eggs benedict in hollandaise to the point you can't even see the bottom and the english muffin gets really soggy. \n\nMy boyfriend's blueberry pancakes weren't that awesome either.  Kind of spongey and flavorless.\n\nFor the hype this location gets, it wouldn't be my first choice.

Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. \n\nEven though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. \n\nIt honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.\n\nThe dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. \n\nFOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning \nTOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this one","date":"2010-01-23 22:00:16"}

The menu is very extensive, which is surprising, because they do most of the items on the menu VERY well.\n\nBetween the 4 of us that tried Egg & I, we each got different dishes and were all very happy with the food. The portion size is huge as well. If you're not that hungry, share with someone. The omelettes are made with not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 eggs. FOUR EGGS. It's a beast omelette among eggs.\n\nThree things I will highlight: The eggs benedict, the banana nut muffin, and potatoes.\n--Eggs Benedict: Order this and you will not be disappointed. The hollandaise sauce that's drizzled over the eggs is something that most places mess up, but at Egg & I, it's made to perfection -- smooth, creamy and seasoned just right.\n--Banana Nut Muffin: They give this to you when you order and omelette, and don't miss out. It's the most airy, soft, moist -- yes, moist -- muffin you'll ever eat. It's like they fold air into the batter before baking. THAT GOOD.\n--Potatoes: MY GOD. These are the best side of potatoes I've ever had. I'm convinced they have to be fried, but I'm not sure. The exterior is exquisitely golden crispy with a perfect seasoning blend on the outside. Best potatoes west of the Mississippi; hands down.\n\nPros: Breakfast food for gods\nCons: Can get busy, limited parking","date":"2015-02-19 15:03:14"}

The servers are always smiling and genuinely kind. They are constantly concerned about your food and if everything is tasting good. \n\nFOOD: 3 - My disclaimer: I really only came here to eat eggs. I did not want any meat other than bacon. I strictly came here for really, really plain ol' breakfast food, and not anything else.\n\nI got a really boring item called \"The Classic\", but I really wanted just eggs and bacon, so that's what I went with. My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. I mean, they were absolutely perfect. Some cooks leave the yolk barely runny on the inside, but they are experts at eggs here..and I have no complaints. \n\nThe banana nut muffin was soft and moist, but I just didn't like the taste of it. I think I'm just picky, but the banana in the muffin tasted a little ripe. The potatoes were good, but they weren't great. The bacon was a little overcooked and a little too hard for me. \n\nI totally forgot to check Yelp before ordering, but next time, I'll order a healthy omelet and see how that goes!!","date":"2015-01-24 06:37:26"}

Well let me tell you, the bacon was hard and chewy and the pancakes were like chewing on their old recycled newspaper menus. It was like eating 100 crackers that you were unable to swallow. My BF got the eggs benedict that came with potatoes. The potatoes were like hollow skins with no meat inside and were salted beyond belief. I think we left swollen from all the water retention..

So I went basic with buttermilk pancakes and eggs and bacon. Everyone's eggs were cooked perfectly. Bacon crispy as I had requested. Short stack of 2 pancakes was more than I could finish. My husband and a friend each got some sort of skillet concoction, and I probably didn't finish my pancakes because my fork kept was always in his skillet because it was so good!

We had breakfast there twice over a recent trip to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My first meal was the Ultimate Skillet. Bring a large appetite! My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and all the ingredients were so tasty and fresh. I also enjoyed their sourdough toast. It was thick, flavorful, and buttery! The dish was so yummy and substantial.  It kept me going until late in the afternoon. My wife had the Bacon, Avocado, & Cheese omelette. She loved it. It was cooked to perfection; a uniform yellow color and cooked evenly through.  It was loaded with lots of avocado.  She said that it was maybe the best she's ever had. Wow!\n\nI had to cut back on my next visit. I ate too much on the first one, although I really enjoyed it (trying to be good in Vegas???). I ordered the Eggs-Plus with ham. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right.  The ham was good. It was not dry, chewy or too salty. The potatoes were also good. The server helped my wife make substitutions to the Flapper which made her her happy. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too? She rated the pancakes 5 stars!   Another great breakfast.\n\nI must commend the staff here. They are welcoming, friendly, and they are willing to accommodate you so that you are satisfied with your meal. I am looking forward to my next Vegas trip so that I can eat there again.","date":"2012-04-06 19:41:02"}

I came here with Don, but I really wasn't very hungry, so I just ordered a cream cheese danish. Don ordered some sort of potato soup and a tuna salad sandwich. His meal was pretty good, especially the very hearty soup. However, my danish was very floppy and seemed kind of soggy. I could completely fold it taco style because it had no \"crisp\" to it at all (http:\/\/s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com\/bphoto\/dk70gFzNfCOjgd3aN7N0_w\/l.jpg).

Today, I just wanted to give a couple of shot outs to Brady, the Assistant Manager, and to Jesus, whom I discovered is a 20-yr  employee of the Egg & I. \n\nJesus is a busboy. On my last two visits prior to the one I'm writing about (this past Monday, Memorial Day), Jesus has asked me if I needed anything to let him know, which he did again on this visit. Jesus is ALWAYS willing to help, and has gotten me coffee, filled my coffee and even scored me an extra banana nut muffin or two before. Not really his job, as his is to clean tables and make sure their customers have somewhere nice to be seated, but Jesus ALWAYS goes above and beyond what is expected of him to do, and I appreciate his hard work.\n\nWhich brings me to Brady, the young Assistant Manager. Brady is definitely young enough to be my little brother. Brady is a genuine, bonafide talker. He shoots the shit with you, but real talk. Not fake talk like I'm only here to make it look like I care about you talk, but good ol' fashioned back and forth banter. He has a tattoo on one of his forearms that says \"Family First\", and Brady made me feel like family! While shooting it with him, I told him that we had just come from Laughlin but had to detour cause one of my wife's uncles fell ill and ended up in the hospital and guess what Brady did? He sent me home with a loaf of their bomb ass banana nut bread to take to my uncle at the hospital since I told him that's where we were heading after breakfast! THANK YOU AGAIN BRADY! I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS!\n\nI'll end this review with a little bit about the food.........my Italiano skillet was on point, AS USUAL. Onion, bell pepper and sausages were all cooked to damn near perfection, it had just the right amount of marinara and cheese that didn't drown or overwhelm, and to be quite honest, have they every messed up a batch of their famous potatoes?","date":"2016-06-04 01:18:04"}

The breakfast is always consistent and good. Although I've never had lunch here I can tell you I have been having breakfast here for a very long time. My favorite thing to order for breakfast is Chorizo & Eggs. From time to time I also like to order the Patriot Belgian Waffle which is very good. I also like the Viva La France French Toast two pieces of brioche bread dipped in homemade batter and griddled golden brown. If you like omelettes I would recommend two, first the Egg-Ceptional Omelette (Sausage, Smoked Ham, Crisp Bacon, House-Roasted Onions, Tomatoes and Crimini Mushrooms with melted Jack and Cheddar) topped with sour cream and fresh herbs. Served with dressed greens and an English muffin. It's very good and possibly their most popular Omelette. My personal favorite is the Mexican Omelette (Chorizo, Chiles, House-Roasted Onions, Jack and Cheddar) topped with salsa or pork green chili, sour cream and fresh herbs.

Not many places can make a good chile relleno entre, alertos is the only place in oc, imo, but eggs and i got it right.\n\nThe south west type was also a good omlete.

This plate was a good addition to the overall meal. \n\nThe gf ordered a carrot cake french toast. She said it was ok in comparison to the chile relleno omlete *cough cough*.

Since it was our first time, she also gave us complimentary banana nut muffins. DELICIOUS.\n\nFOOD:\nSO. DAMN. GOOD.\n\nLarge portion sizes and excellent flavor!\n\nI ordered the bacon and avocado omelette and was super impressed. \n\nThe seasoned potatoes were perfect, too.

I have never ordered anything I didn't like. The Eggs Benedict is my favorite followed by the chili omelet.

You have to get here and soon. This has to be one of the best breakfasts my wife and I have had. The potatoes were seasoned phenomenally and my bacon and onion skillet was a taste of heaven. I asked for green chillies to be added and it sent it over the top with flavor. Sourdough toast was as good if not better than some of the offerings out of San Francisco. Get in your car and drive a few miles off the strip. It'll be worth the short trip. You deserve to have a breakfast that's not from a trough at the casino. This is a locals type place but friendly for visitors too.

There is an open air patio in the back (pets allowed). Booths in the middle, tables along the walls. \n\nThe entryway deserves a paragraph to itself.\n One. Big. Clusterf**k. People are waiting to be seated and are either sitting along the walls or standing (most likely in the way of someone). People are lining up to be placed on the seating wait list. People are sitting or standing along the wall just inside the dining room and outside of the front door. People are ordering food to-go. People are lining up or grouping together like a human barricade, waiting to pay their bill. Honestly, even the hostess could not tell me where the line ended to pay the bill.

This was just plain GROSS. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of ICEBURG LETTUCE. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. They gave me 1\/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word EGG in it.. i was very disappointed. You'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no.\non top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since I've lived here. \n\nMaybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. I take some responsibility in that I guess. my bf's omelet was delicious. the potatoes were good.. so was his banana nut muffin.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin\/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & I... and yes good food vs. bad food. \n\nThe only reason I gave them 2stars was b\/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :) \nHere's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & I.","date":"2011-07-12 19:26:39"}

I've ate here many many times and give them a solid 4 overall. \n\nGets a little busy so don't go in a hurry but I like this place a lot. I want to give them a 5 star so maybe I could update later if some minor things change.\n\nCheckout line gets pretty long almost every time so they need 2 cashiers or a faster system.\n\nIt takes awhile to get seated sometimes but they did update the seating list so you can get a text when your table is ready. It gives you an estimate on how long the wait will be.  Our quote said 15 minute wait to get seated but it was 21 min, it was a group of 6 during busy time so not bad and that was the longest I have waited.\n\nFood is pretty good, chorizo burrito and mashed potato omelette are very edible. \n\nI really wish they wouldn't give you so many of those weird potatoes though. They are pretty good but not good enough to finish or take home, so almost every customer is sure to throw away a lot, my guess is they through away a few hundred pounds of potatoes every single day because no one finishes them. I would recommend they give you half the amount of potatoes and some fruit which would be so much easier on the stomach and make the meals a little less boring. \n\nI do recommend to stop by and give this place a try though. I will certainly be back soon. \n\nThanks Egg & I!","date":"2017-09-25 09:37:35"}

We had a table of 7, and 6 received their meals within a reasonable amount of time, except me of course!  Not one word was said to me, so we put an unhappy face on Mr Egg, but I still had to flag down our waitress, which took at least 5 minutes.  She seemed pretty annoyed when I asked where my food was. She said \"we can only put 4 orders on one ticket, so yours will take longer\". Hmm so why did 6 orders came out???  Finally, someone else came out because of the unhappy face on Mr Egg, and asked what she could do. I said everyone is almost done with their breakfast and I don't have mine. She went to check, making sure that we put the happy face back on Mr. Egg.. A few minutes later, our waitress came back and said that they were still baking the biscuits, and promised that she was watching for my order. Hmm, by then 3 people at my table had finished their breakfast. After another 5 minutes everyone was done eating , Finally a different person brought my order, with the explanation \"they poached the eggs, so they had to remake it with my cooked eggs\".  Ok which one of you clucks the truth?  So I got to eat while 6 people at my table watched me, so needless to say I ate pretty fast and didn't get to enjoy the egg-cellent food.  I'm pretty easy going when it comes to food orders, as normally we all do our best, But by the time I got my food and had to listen to 3 different reasons, I really did expect for them to take my meal (and only my meal) off of the bill. Was that too much to ask? Well I left with egg on my face, no discount...not even an apology. All I got was a \"there now you have your breakfast, you are all set\".  Really???

He enjoyed his meal but didn't even touch his bacon because the pancakes are a pretty decent size with fresh blueberries in the pancake and on the side was a blueberry jam sauce? It was sweet just as he likes it. I'm not a huge pancake fan so I don't make it much at home so he was happy. I ordered the chile rellenos omelette and I'm so glad I did!

As always, I turned to Yelp. I was craving Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. my cousin wanted an Omelette and my Niece wanted pancakes or waffles. Yelp brought up several options and I read the reviews. The Egg and I had everything we wanted and the reviews were good. So, off we went. We got there pretty fast from the Strip about 15 mins. Upon our arrival the place was full. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait but a table came up outside rather quickly. It was a hot day but we were starving and they had cooling mist sprayers which helped a bit. We were greeted by our waiter OSCAR who was friendly and hospitable. He took our drink order, mad some recommendations from the Specials and left us to figure out our orders. He delivered the drinks with these Bannana Nut muffins we didn't ask for. I didn't want the muffin but after I had a pinch I was hooked. Yes, it was warm and delicious. With the size of my breakfast I decided to save it for breakfast the next day. We placed our orders and no time after that we had our orders. The food looked and tasted great. The portions were large and pippin hot. We were all silently eating and enjoying our meal. \n\nOk for the review. I am really specific about my chicken fried steak and I rarely get it because it usually sucks unless my mom or Southern grandma made it. But this one was quite good I must admit. My only complaint was with the potatoes. They were cooked well nice and crispy but was a bit salty. I prefer to add my own salt to taste because of that. My family agreed that their potatoes were also a bit salty. But overall our food was delicious and the service Great!!\n\nOscar is truly great at his job and we truly appreciated his service. We would gladly go to The Egg & I again without hesitation.\n\nOh....and the Bannana Nut muffin was AWESOME the next day with coffee :-)","date":"2017-08-20 05:22:37"}

My friend tried the ultimate skillet which had ham, bacon,  sausage and other goodies, but he said that it was waaaay too many things going on in one dish.

Part of the plan has you delaying breakfast until you get to Las Vegas, and the plan is working pretty well so far.  At Barstow you get out your phone and you begin to review the non casino options in Las Vegas when 'Egg and I' leaps out with these great reviews and a fantastic star rating.  Sold!

I had ordered the chile rellano omelette, and it arrived as advertised, but with just a ton of cheese.  \n\nSecond, the potatoes looked to be cubed by a machine, frozen, de-frosted, and then lightly seasoned prior to arrival.  They were very disappointing.  \n\nThird, my expectations were way too high.  My fellow yelpers love this place, and so I was expecting this amazing breakfast that just didn't live up to my expectations.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd probably go back, but with a whole different set of expectations, knowing that I'd ask for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes, and I'd probably not choose an omelette.\n\nBe sure and check in, a free muffin is not a bad thing.","date":"2015-06-27 20:30:17"}

I also ordered a side of bacon which was perfectly done. My husband had the waffles which were huge and came with strawberries and whipped cream, eggs and bacon it was really good. I tasted from everyone's respective egg plates and they were all amazing. I believe there was a Vegetable Skillet and a Little Piggy at the table and those were divine. There were two fruit plates that came with cantalope, blueberries, strawberries and some other fruits. The ranch potatoes were amazing just the right mix of crispy and soft....I wish that I liked breakfast...one of my friends said that the pancakes here were the best she has ever had and she is a bit of a pancake snob. The portions were huge and the prices were right. You cannot go wrong with hitting up the Egg and I if you are into breakfast or with a bunch of people who are into breakfast.

Portions were more than fair and the food was fresh and tasted delicious! We will definitely head back here on our next Vegas trip!","date":"2016-04-18 20:16:30"}

The thing I liked about the omelet was that it wasn't too oily like in other omelettes I've had. Cheese was a little too much for me as well.\nMy friend and I split the strawberry cream cheese French toast. If you don't mind having gobs of strawberry jelly and whip cream on your French toast, this is definitely for you!

Today was my first time inside for breakfast at 1:30pm.  So glad I finally stopped in!\n\nAll the reviews talk about their bannana nut muffin, but more on that later, first - the eggs...   I ordered the biscuits and gravy which comes with a side of 2 eggs (I chose scrambled) and a side of potatoes (the server allowed me to sub half of the potatoes for fresh fruit.\n\nEverything on my large plate was done perfectly.  The eggs were warm, tasty, and not under or over done.  The biscuits were deliciously moist and puffy (best I've had in as long as i can remember) with a very nice sausage gravy.  The potatoes were original and had a nice texture but the seasoning was a bit much for my taste.  And the fresh fruit was very sweet and well, fresh!  I really don't have a single complaint about the food.  I'd go here regularly for breakfast if it were closer to my house.\n\nFor first time goers you get a banana nut muffin on the house.  I don't care if you aren't a big fan of banana nut muffins, I'm really not.  But just eat it!  You won't regret it.  I don't know what they put in this pastry (sprinkled crack maybe?) but it was amazing.\n\nAs far as  the employees go, they all seemed happy, smiling, and they were genuinely nice.  There was no wait for me although I heard i just missed a rush.  everyone from the hostess to the servers to the cook did everything just right in my opinion.\n\nPrices are fair for breakfast.  My large plate with an iced tea came to eleven bucks and change.  More than what I'm used to paying for breakfast, but worthy for the quality of the feast, and I'd happily hand it over again.","date":"2012-07-26 23:46:53"}

Speaking of which, when the waitress asked what bread he wanted on the side, he said none, and she offered to bring him a side of fruit. He was very appreciative.

Did we come on a bad day or what? \n\nThe 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. \n\nWe got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. I ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. I feel like I might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. \n\nAftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes I decided on the chicken fried steak skillet since I am a big fan of all things chicken friend. The 3 others got the Mexican omelet, I believe that is what it was called. \n\nThe food came out pretty quick, first glance at my chicken fried skillet made me queesy but I was hungry and I thought it can't be that bad. The country gravy was gelatinous. It was weird. Like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. Whatever. Give it a try. \n\nIt didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. It was very salty and I just couldn't get over the slime gravy so I stopped eating. Everyone else with their Mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. Apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. My partner is Mexican and loves her spicy foods. She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. \n\nAnyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. \n\nAs you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. Never again.","date":"2014-12-27 20:50:36"}

(excuse the puns please) The people here are really nice and its nice being somewhere in Las Vegas where not everyone there is a tourist.\n\n So I had the eggs florentine which was really good. My motto is the more fattening the better. The hollandaise sauce was creamy, buttery and probably loaded with saturated fat, which is completely fine with me. The eggs were poached just right, where it's firm on the outside but soft inside. The side of potatoes are really good too.

I have never been to this particular restaurant, but I think I recognize the manager from my visit to the Flamingo store.  She impressed me with her rejection of food at the pass-through to make sure the quality was up to her standards.  My food pretty much reflected that same quality I experienced at the other store.  I had the prime rib benedict which is diced prime rib with sauted spinich and roasted red bell pepper on top of a croissant with the hollandaise.  This was outstanding.  The hollandaise was just the right amount combined with the egg yolk produced the best benedict I have ever had.  I know thier home fries are deep fried cubes which is not my preference (I like hash), so I asked them to not even bring the potatoes.  I ordered a short stack of blueberry pancakes just to try them.  They are served with a compote on the side and syrup on the side. I just wanted to eat the edge of the cakes and they did have a little texture, but not as crispy as I would have liked.  The compote didn't taste homemade. It reminded me of the Comstock out of a can.  The syrup is also a maple flavored corn syrup as opposed to real maple syrup.  But...  butter is butter and that really works well with pancakes, so I had my edges with butter and it was good. For the price, I can't expect too much gourmet.  I think what you get for the money, you are getting a great product and the service is the key to this well oiled machine.  Friendly staff and a high degree of quality makes this chain a winner and that's hard to find in Vegas.","date":"2012-07-03 17:50:32"}

The service was quick and respectful and the food was a savory spectacle. \n\nWe were a group of six arriving at peak brunch hour and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Our dining experience began when we checked in on Yelp to get a free batch of their acclaimed banana nut muffins. Our server served them to us warm and they were perfect to peak our appetites for what was to be a massive, hearty breakfast. I ordered my own creation of the The Works skillet with country gravy on top while the rest of my group tried different variations of the Eggs Benny. The country gravy was the best I've ever had and the fresh ingredients in the rest of the skillet balanced the whole meal out. I was impressed with my friend's Eggs Bennies as well.

Told the waitress they forgot it and to forget about bringing it. She began to goad me on to get avocado, which was strange after saying no several times. I repeated that it was fine; at that point i didn't care for it. Eventually I submitted but asked for only a little amount of avocado. She brings me avocado and soon after - the check. I look at the check, no avocado charge. I was happy, and ready to pay. A few minutes later, she sneakily replaces the check with a brand new one. I hardly noticed that she had done that and after looking at the check again, a $3 avocado charge made me cringe. Wtf? If it was your mistake and I said I was fine on avocado, why would you goad me on to get it? Then give me a check without it (again forgetting, but this time you forgot to charge me so might as well leave it), and replace it with a ridiculous charge? And do not call your customers \"babe\", it's just weird especially when you say it behind them. \"Thanks babe\" - as I was holding the check in my hand. Thanks? No thanks lol.I wish I remembered her name, but she was some older red-haired lady. I was not pleased with this incident.\nAlso, their \"Habla Diablo\" potatoes, which comes with every meal, are horrendous. They taste like over seasoned, beyond-salty fast food potatoes. 2 stars for getting seated quick, polite service, and a banana \"nut\" muffin for a side, despite the fact that it was overly sweet and did not receive the slightest bit of nutty flavor.

Plan ahead.  The menu is huge, and a little confusing, as the staples are towards the back (eggs, pancakes and waffles) while they seem to push several styles of eggs Benedict and four-egg omelettes (not a fan, blech.)  Service was what I expect from a half-decent diner - fast and punctual.  My waffle was not served with real maple syrup, which was a major bummer.  The potatoes that are included with the standard egg breakfast were small squares but were cooked perfectly and tasted a lot like French fries from Fuddruckers (heavy on the Thyme, which gives them a reddish, golden-brown color.) There's a little stand at the table with two metal egg badges. The first, in black, is a happy egg face which states to the wait staff that all is well.  The second is an egg-face in bright yellow with a somewhat consternated egg-face which signifies to the wait staff that you're either unhappy with the meal, but mostly tells them you need something.  I was in a particularly crappy mood, so I kept flipping the egg-face to the bright yellow unhappy egg-face, and the waitress was getting perturbed with me.  The turkey sausage was pretty tasty, so I'd recommend people order it if they decide to eat here.  In general, take it or leave it.","date":"2016-02-15 20:36:34"}

However, the pancakes were HUGE and 3 came with the order. I barely even touched them because I was almost full from the hash. I was pretty upset that I dropped $6.25 for an order of pancakes that I had less than 1\/4 of because of the shear size. I feel the server could've let me know they were huge and given me an option.

The place was packed, obviously very popular.\n\nThe menu is extensive, quite a few breakfast items to choose from. Obviously eggs are the feature here with a large omelette selection. The place is homey, and they have murals of farm lands all over the walls. \n\nI decided to get the Mexican Omelette - Chorizo, chiles and onions and cheese, topped with sour cream. Came with a heaping side of potatoes and choice of bread - I got wheat.\n\nOverall I was kind of underwhelmed by the dish. Usually I love chorizo, but for some reason this omelette just did not meld like it should. \n\nService was SLOW. Yes, it was busy on a Saturday, but there came a point when my husband looked up and said, \"Where's the food?\". Never a good sign when you actually start questioning whether or not they put the order in.\n\nThey did have a very yummy banana nut muffin, which I highly suggest getting if you come here. AND (as of this writing) if you check in on Yelp, you get one for free!\n\nThis is definitely a go-to breakfast spot if you live in the area. But, if you live elsewhere in the valley I am sure you can find a place that is just as good, if not better. I still like Black Bear Diner over Egg & I for breakfast.","date":"2015-05-18 22:30:03"}

Seriously!\n\nI will say - my coworker and I were in Las Vegas for work.  It was a Friday, around noon and we had finished with our client earlier than expected. We did a Google search to see what was available close by for food as neither of us had a chance to have a real breakfast that morning.  After scrolling past several chains I landed on a name that wasn't familiar and highly rated - Egg & I.  I was later a little bummed to discover that Egg & I is in fact a chain, as I had hoped it was local to the area (I was unfamiliar with it being from the Northeast\/Mid-Atlantic region and never encountering one before).  I will tell you though - I did not regret choosing this place for a late breakfast\/early lunch.\n\nWhen we pulled up the place was hopping.  A good sign that we picked a good place.  Inside there appeared to be a mix of both tourists and locals.  Although they were busy, we were seated very quickly.  Every plate I passed on the way to the table had breakfast food on it, and it all looked and smelled amazing.\n\nThe menu was quite extensive... what you would typically find in a diner.  The omelettes and breakfast skillets sounded especially appealing, and come to find out are their most popular choices.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and very helpful in providing menu suggestions.  When she found out it was our first time there, she insisted on bringing us fresh banana nut muffins - which was a great touch!\n\nThe muffins were divine - served warm, they were thick and rich.  Like a really good banana bread in muffin form.\n\nI chose to get an egg white omelette with mushrooms, spinach, artichokes and cheese.  It came cooked perfectly and I liked that the cheese was smothered on top and not actually in the omelette.  It was a nice twist.  The breakfast potatoes served on the side were also cooked perfectly - crisp (and not greasy!) on the outside, soft on the inside and seasoned with a signature mix of spices.  Based on what I've seen online, most other locations do seasoned ranch potatoes.  I liked the Vegas location's spicier take!  It had a kick, but wasn't too spicy.  I liked the blend of seasoning so much, I purchased a bottle to take home with me.\n\nMy coworker ordered a skillet and raved about how delicious it was!  \n\nEven though the place is a chain, they must be locally franchised and I really liked how the Vegas location had the feeling of a locally owned place.  \n\nGreat food, great people and it was less than 15 minutes from the Strip and airport.  I'd definitely take the trek out for a meal or two on my next Vegas trip.","date":"2017-06-13 18:18:35"}

I opt for a chilli omelette because I wanted more protein and it was decent for under $10, came out exactly how I expected a chili omelette to be.

We got it off of the Triple D website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. While it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:\n\nMy mother and I both have a food allergy to Monosodium Glutamate more commonly known as MSG. It is a flavor enhancer\/ preservative often found in foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). For me, a little is OK, but my mother can't eat it at all. \n\nWhen we sat down at the table, we asked if they used MSG more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? Our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. My mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated Chicken Fried Steak, had to change her order. Both of chose the Sunrise Mountain and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the Habla Diablo potatoes that came with 90% of the breakfast options.\n\nWhen the food came out it looked delicious, but one bite changed our opinion. While it was plentiful, it was bland. Even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.\n\nMy father, who does not share my MSG allergy, ordered a skillet. Mom and I both took a bite of the Habla Diablo potatoes from his plate and they were delicious. Crunchy and flavorful, I would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing MSG. And the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).\n\nI gave this place two stars because the service was good and the banana nut muffins delicious. Now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals...","date":"2015-07-09 20:16:46"}

I am use to eating corned beef out of a can where the meat is more like ground beef compared to this place where the meat is shredded, and oh man that was awesome. So as you can read, I ordered the corned beef hash which does come with 2 eggs made whatever way you'd like, some pretty good, crispy, special seasoned cut potatoes, and a choice of a banana nut muffin or toast of choice. The waitress was nice enough to pass out free muffins for everyone, the muffin sounded good and everyone at other tables had them, but in actuallity it was only ok. I probably should have went for the toast, but looking at my friend's toast, I will say that they put a lot of butter on it, so if you don't want that shit, make sure to tell them, because I don't think they'll tell you. Oh also forgot to mention that the order also comes with two random slices of fruit.\n\nI actually felt a tad overwhelmed, not by the meat, but the potatoes, while great, it was just so much starch to digest, but non the less, it was still satisfactory and the flavorings in each bite were awesome. \n\nService was awesome but paying at the end seemed to drag because we had to wait in line to pay at the register....but regardless, I would definitely go here for breakfast if I ever wake up in time during my Vegas trips.","date":"2013-04-01 18:42:49"}

At first bite they taste over seasoned with cajun powder but by the end of it you will wish you had more. The banana nut muffin comes with your entree or free check in on foursquare. It's definitely not the best muffin int he world like others claim, but it is tasty. However, eat it hot or it might taste dry. And eat it with the butter then its perfection.

Normally, I do not go off the strip to eat. I don't think this place is as good as the reviews lead it to be... the place was packed when I went though, around 11am. It took about 30 minutes or so for a table. Looking at the menu, LOTS of stuff looked good and I had trouble deciding what to eat. The menu is a newpaper, which is actually really cute and different; also, there is a lot of word-play on the menu which I thought was cleaver. I ended up getting the chicken fried steak skillet and my brother got the carnitas skillet. Both did taste good, but I did not think it was spectacular. Portions were a good size, a bit larger than average. My chicken steak was tender and crispy and the gravy was good... but the house potatoes it came with was way too salty. I mixed everything together to try to lessen the salt taste, but in the end, I couldn't finish all the potatoes because, well, it was just too much salt. I think they need to put less of the seasoned salt on it. I'm a total potato lover and I couldn't finish my potatoes. My skillet also came with 2 eggs, anyway you want and a muffin or toast. I chose the muffin. It was good-average. I tried a bit of the carnitas skillet... but I'm not a big Mexican food fan... so it wasn't to my liking really, but my brother liked it. His did not come with a muffin or toast though. I also ordered coffee, thinking it was going to come in the interesting cup I see posted... it came in the ugly typical diner coffee cup...\n\nPersonally, I think Hash House A Go-Go has much better food and better prices... and way bigger portions!! My brother agrees with me too. \n\nI don't think this place is worth the wait... it didn't stand out in my mind. Just an average breakfast place. Prices are fair... my chicken fried skillet was $10.50 and the carnitas skillet was about $11. \n\nGo to Hash House A Go-Go if you want special yummy breakfast food... this place is just average.","date":"2013-11-27 06:30:28"}

The host and servers both gave us a warm welcome. My favorite part of the table set up was their egg signal at the top of their center piece. It was a photo of an egg that you could flip to indicate to servers that you needed something. No one waving your hand to try to get the servers attention, they got a system down!\n\nNext, the food, I ordered corned beef hash and eggs, while my friend customized her scramble with chorizo plus biscuits and gravy.. The bf got some avocado omelette. All were delicious and the portions were huge! It looked like I barley made a dent in my food, but I was stuffed. The biscuits and gravy were probably some of the best I've had... And their banana nut muffins are worth a try for muffin fiends.

Not even busy. But right when we opened the door, crowds poured out, and we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table for two. The wall decor by the waiting place was cute. There were cartoons as well as sayings about eggs. Finally, we were led to our table by a super friendly and bubbly waitress.\n\nThe menu is printed like a newspaper - cool!! I've never seen that before!! (Yes I took a picture with it.) The selection is pretty extensive considering that every single item on the menu are made with eggs (like skillet items, omelettes, etc), so it took us a while to decide. I forget what we ended up getting - it was a while ago, pardon me - but I remember it being soooo good! They also customize your order so that you can have whole eggs vs egg substitutes vs egg whites, etc... Definitely get the fresh banana nut bread!! We almost got a loaf to take home back to LA even though we weren't leaving for LA yet.\n\nThe service was superb. Our waitress kept coming by to check up on us. When the busboy accidentally tossed our leftovers, the waitress felt so bad that she went back to the kitchen and got us some other foods to take with us. This was one place where I seriously went in not expecting much and left completely satisfied with the full intention of coming back next time I am in Vegas.","date":"2009-01-21 08:13:32"}

Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!\n\nWe went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is.

Thank you fellow Yelpers!  This place was fantastic. We had a party of five and waited all of about two minutes to be seated. We must have hit the right time of morning because the place was jammed by the time we left. Well worth any wait. \n\nFood - The menu was expansive. So many items to choose from. I had the Three Pig Omelette with a side of their excellent hollandaise sauce. Superb. My son was pleased with his waffle. My wife, who is not a huge breakfast fan, was thrilled to see she could get an egg white omelette. She commented that you never really know how egg white dishes will turn out. She raved about her egg white veggie omelette. The two others in our party had the the biscuits and gravy and loco moco respectively. The biscuits and gravy were a hit while the loco moco was remarkably reminiscent to the Hawaiian Islands favorite dish. \n\nService - The service was exceptional. In an industry where service can significantly impact the diner's experience, Oscar was fantastic. Oscar was well versed in his menu knowledge and was quick to offer recommendations and to gladly accept order substitutions. His pleasant, respectful, and appreciative demeanor really helped to set our dining experience apart from every other experience while in town. He was also aware and kind enough to notice the kitchen was getting backed up so he brought out a plateful of banana nut muffins to help stunt the growing hunger we all were suffering. \n\nOverall - Highly recommend this restaurant for the wonderful combination of great food and top-notch service.","date":"2017-04-14 20:28:40"}

All I have to say is THANK YOU MY FELLOW YELPERS for giving this place decent reviews, for had it not been for you, I would have broken down and paid 30 or 40 bucks for brunch.  Because of you, I have now found my go to breakfast joint EVERY TIME I GO TO VEGAS.\n\nLet me start of by saying, if you are staying at the Stratosphere, this is the perfect place for you because its only about 3 miles away. Getting right into the joint, it's always a good sign when you step into a restaurant, and its jammed packed with patrons, and an even better sign when you can smell nothing but breakfast goodness as you pull into the parking lot.\n\nWait time for our party of 9 was probably about an hour, but it was okay since 7 stragglers in my party were still packing back at their hotels. The coffee, was shite to be perfectly honest, but when you are nursing a hangover, brownie points are scored because they bring you the coffee in the carafe, almost one per coffee drinker, so you never have to look around for a waitress to refill your cup.\n\nI had the Brad's corned beef hash, and it was HEAVENLY! I recommend getting the half order because with their kick ass potatoes (cubed and superbly seasoned with season salt) and two eggs, it ends up being a hell of a lot of food, especially after eating their freshly baked banana nut muffin. MAJOR POINTS for the corned beef hash  being made from scratch. My wife had some kind of pork chile verde skillet, and she wasn't disappointed, and neither was my mother in law who ordered a spinach, cheese, onion and tomato scramble. Blueberry pancakes were a little off as they were extremely dense, but we'll see what happens next time we go.\n\nThe biggest plus for this restaurant is the fact that their service is impeccable. I can honestly say that I wish every restaurant had service as awesome as Egg and I's. Their entire staff is friendly, attentive and make you feel like you were a regular customer! See you in May Egg and I!","date":"2011-03-04 03:36:15"}

I was sold on all the ingredients and the dish was amazing and flavorful.\n\nBacon, avocado and cheese omelette: full of bacon flavor and packed with avocados.  Usually when I get avocado with my omelette it is served sparingly with just a few pieces on top.  They were not stingy with it and filled it completely.\n\nCorned beef hash: the good stuff, not canned corn beef.  Eggs and toast were included.\n\nAll the dishes were served with a side of ranch potatoes, which is amazing in itself.  I would eat the potatoes alone!\n\n Priced well with large portions.

It was approaching noon, but I still had my heart set on breakfast.  \n\nWe were seated quickly.  The service was ok. I don't know in what order the food went in or what, but this is what I noticed. \n\nThere were 2 tables in front of my view.  One table got seated 5 minutes after us and the other table seemed like they were wating forever for their food.  I'm assuming the manager, went up to the table and apologized for their food not getting there yet.  I then noticed the table who sat down 5 mintues AFTER us got served their food first.  I looked at the hubby and said, \"how did that happen?\" AND they were served way BEFORE the table that was waiting.  So something happened to communication from the servers and the kitchen.   \n\nI got the chicken fried steak.  When we got our food I was lovin' the potatoes!!  My scramble eggs were over cooked and hard - really no flavor.  My chicken fried steak was good, but the put sooo much gravy, I had to take half of it off.   \n\nOverall, the place is a good spot for breakfast in Vegas.

Then, when I got their potato scramble, the cheese all over the top was hard and not the soft, melted type of cheese. So if you ate your potatoes, you could pick up a whole layer of cheese.

While I didn't find their eggs Benedict too salty (I am not salt sensitive), the MSG in the Hollindaise was palpable and the famous Diablo potatoes were \"meh\" (and I like spicy!). On the plus side, their banana nut muffins were delicious, as advertised.","date":"2015-07-10 16:46:47"}

I love this place!!   It's one of those bfast places where there are mugs on the table and the server brings you a giant pot of coffee and leaves it with you at your disposal.  There were different types of pre-packaged cream and sugars, including hot sauces, ketchup, and a little egg sign which you can flip over if you need servicing.  Not as ingenious as the button at Korean bbq places, but it works!\n\nMost entrees come with a side of toast or homemade banana nut muffin.  I'm not a big fan of banana nut but my god, theirs is just divine. Spongey, soft, moist, slightly sweet and with just the perfect flavor of fresh banana flavor and a little hint of crunch from the nuts.  The nuts aren't bitter either, as some walnuts can be and it was just pure perfection.\n\nBH and I went a little buckwild (as we always do) and we ordered three dishes: eggs benedict florentine, a half order of corned beef hash, and the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon.  The benedict was awesome and was smothered in creamy hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were soft and runny but the English muffin was still crispy and chewy.  The stuffed french toast was pretty good.  BH gobbled up the entire plate whereas I had just a bite or two.  I thought there was too much egg and not enough bacon, but BH told me it was great with maple syrup.  I like sweet meats and breads, but I haven't gotten accustomed to sweet scrambled eggs yet, so I never tried it dipped in sticky sweet maple. Finally, the corned beef hash was very fresh and I could definitely tell it was homemade and not from a can.  The chunks of potato were creamy and starchy while the chunks of meat were flavorful, salty, and a little reminiscent of dog food (but in a good way).  The over easy egg on top made it even more delectable.\n\nFinally, one of the best parts of the meal, besides the banana nut muffin, were their ranch potatoes.  They are roasted to a perfect crunch and seasoned with some sort of red powder - possibly paprika for a bit of smokiness?  They were so damn good, that even past my stuffing point, I kept stabbing at the potatoes so I could get every last bit in my mouth.  Needless to say, BH  and I were nearly bursting by the time we left Egg & I.  I call that a sign of good breakfast and a good start to a day.","date":"2011-12-16 00:56:08"}

We were undecided between the Egg & I and another place we saw on Yelp with great reviews.  We'd gotten rid of our rental car the day before so we'd have to take a taxi to either.  At the spur of the moment, we picked the Egg & I.  Yay for us for picking an awesome joint.  We waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  I'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.  They were banana nut muffins.  We both ate the entire thing.  So good.  And with a great cup of coffee, we could've stopped right there.  But we didn't!  Since breakfast is not my favorite meal, I love it when I find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  There were so many options I had to choose from.  I was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the Tacos Rancheros.  I chose the Tacos Rancheros.  It was a tortilla topped with refried beans, ground hamburger, two eggs (which I got fried) and topped with cheese and sour cream.  I would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  My partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  It was enormous.  She could only eat half of it to which our server, Karla suggested getting the half order next time!  Shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  But, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  We both loved the Old Bay seasoned fried potatoes.  As we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  Very nice.  Oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  That's a brilliant idea!

It was really busy when we arrived but the wait wasn't too terrible. We were seated inside, and it was really bustling. \nWith our Yelp check-in, we each received a free banana nut muffin, which was REALLY tasty. I ordered the Vegetarian Benedict (with bacon) and my husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and Blueberry Pancakes. My Benedict was really, really good, but I will say their hollandaise is seriously lacking in lemon juice. It didn't seem like an authentic hollandaise at all, but it tasted good. They know how to poach an egg beautifully, which made up for the sauce. The breakfast potatoes that come with every entree are very flavorful and crispy. My husband really liked his biscuits & gravy (he said the biscuits were very light and fluffy), but the pancakes were a huge bust for both of us. They were way too dense - the texture was pretty awful. I'm assuming that's how all their pancake batter is, so I'd hard pass on pancakes there. \nIt was fun to venture off the Strip, but we'll probably stick with breakfast elsewhere in the future. HOWEVER, they offer an extremely generous military discount of 30%, which we appreciated.

Easy location just west of the strip. Went on a Wednesday morning, got seated right away. \nIMHO, nothing special. Got an egg white veggie omelet.  Pretty plain, though I saved it with ketchup!  Was going to get the stuffed \nFrench Toast, but I love a good omelet.  Just okay here.  Home-style potatoes were good, though they tasted like they had been sitting in the warmer instead of freshly made. Not really large portions.  I did enjoy the banana nut muffin and got one to go.  A friend had huevos rancheros and he really liked it. \nWould I go back?  I doubt it.  Too many places in Vegas that have better service and better food.  Maybe the lunch is better. Maybe if I were a meat eater.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Oh well.  But for me, if you want a place that has better ambience, HUGE portions and a menu that is like a book, go to Hash Hash A Go-Go.","date":"2011-10-23 03:02:52"}

There was only one bad service experience. One of the hosts that was taking our phone number and name to seat us when ready was very rude. She looked very unhappy, and spoke rudely with very few words: \"Phone number....Name....Number of people.\" We gave her the information and she just turned away. Some what rude. After being seated, our server was very polite and kind, an opposite from the host. It being our first visit we asked for recommendations, and he gave us a number of recommendations, from the stuffed french toast to the chili relleno omelette. Because it was our first time, he brought us free banana nut muffins on the house, as a welcome to The Egg and I! First time a restaurant has done that. \n\nFood: 5\/5\n-------------------\nWe ordered the stuffed french toast, traditional eggs benedict, and chili relleno omelette. \n\nStuffed French Toast: 4\/5\nScrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage sandwiched between 2 pieces of french toast. Was good but not amazing. I found it to be dry, but I'd honestly get it again. \n\nEggs Benedict: 5\/5\nThe eggs were perfect, and english muffin perfect texture. However, a bit heavy with the hollandaise sauce. Overall, probably my favorite entree. \n\nChili Relleno Omelette: 4\/5\nCooked perfectly, with lots of flavor. Unique dish with the chilis inside the omelette. Didn't get to try much of it\n\nHabla Diablo Potatoes: 5\/5\nProbably some of the best potatoes I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'd almost compare the texture to McDonalds french fries. They're seasoned with spices and we're very very good!\n\nBanana Nut Muffins: 5\/5\nBest banana nut muffins I've ever had! Not too sweet and very moist. One of my favorite items we got.\n\nOverall: 5\/5\n---------------\nGreat value, food, and customer service. Each person costs around $10-15.

We originally ordered one, but our waitress in her infinite wisdom recommended that we get 2.  Sooo glad we did, because 1, they weren't as big as we thought they'd be, and 2, those suckers are really tasty.\n\nThe stuffed french toast is to die for.  Seriously, I think it'll kill you with all the meat, cheese and butter they manage to stick in there, but it's definitely worth the extra trips to the gym to work it off.  It's a pretty huge portion when you add in the home fries. The previous reviewer that said that it looks like somebody dumped a bottle of Lawry's seasoning on them wasn't kidding. They were orange.\n\nSO got the Mexican Omelette and she couldn't finish it because of the generous portion size, but she enjoyed what she was able to put away. We both enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice.  There's nothing like seeing some honest elbow greased pulp in your juice to let you know it's the real deal.\n\nGreat service, friendly atmosphere, plenty of parking.

Sometimes being on the strip is just too congested and I crave some sense of normalcy... and buffets are just too much food and too expensive.\n\nHence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(\n\nWhen I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.\n\nI tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.\n\nServers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.

She's the breakfast person of the two of us, and she ultimately chose Egg and I of the two places I suggested.\n\nTwo words: No regrets!\n\nThe corned beef was the homemade, pulled type of thing, and not your typical canned corned beef! The Sundance omelette is your veggie omelette complete with a side of potatoes and your choice between a banana nut muffin or toast. This omelette had mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and artichokes. The feta cheese is the one that brings this omelette home! The only downside is that protein is extra; I ordered a small side of corned beef. The potatoes were seasoned (they are on the salty side, but nothing ketchup couldn't counteract). The banana nut muffin came out warm and moist! It definitely was the highlight at first bite! \n\nPortion size: Large! Both of us took home leftovers! We went from stomach growling to food baby status after our meal.\n\nService: You flip the egg to the sad one when you need something. Our servers were very friendly and patient. They gave us recommendations on the menu, one even offered us free muffins for our first visit (before the Yelp check in).\n\nWait Time: immediately seated on a Monday morning\n\nParking: Shared Lot\n\nBottom line: Go here for your breakfast fix!

Both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"  \n\nAnyhow, I try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.\n\nFirst off, the SERVICE was great.  We came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  What's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something I've never seen before.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  She was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  I love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  \n\nAs for the FOOD, my friends and I ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  You could also have your choice of sausage.  Now, I know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items I\"ve ever had.  Everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  I had two eggs that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  Also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a banana nut muffin.  It was the best banana nut muffin I've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.\n\nMy other friends ordered the country fried chicken breast skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  I got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nWhat I found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  It was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  One side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  Apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  Anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that I've been too!\n\nLastly, the PRICE is extremely affordable.  An entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  I sort of wish they had one in Orange County but I'll definitely come back here with friends the next time I visit vegas.","date":"2014-06-24 23:54:36"}

And I usually like my breakfasts to be big, home style, and comfortable. So on my last trip to Vegas, rather than brave the elements of the casino buffet, I decided to get in my car and venture around the city and hit up some of the local spots.\n\nOf course, I hit up Yelp to find out what the breakfast scene was in Las Vegas, and it led me to The Egg & I. This place is located in a strip mall, and has really really good parking. But that's just the small stuff, let's get into the real treasure within.\n\nRight off the bat, you feel totally at home in this place. It's got all the elements of one of those quaint little hometown diners that you know and love and probably grew up with. The staff there is super attentive, and honestly made me feel so welcome as soon as I walked into the door.\n\n I didn't have to wait long at all for someone to come up to my table and asked me what I want to drink. As I slipped on my coffee and looked at the menu, they had a wide variety of stuff to choose from. I settled on the combo plate which had two pancakes scrambled eggs and my choice of sausage, bacon, or sausage patties. I went for the link sausage, because they said that was absolutely the hot ticket. And of course, long-time readers of my Yelp reviews will know that I always order a glass of milk with breakfast as a test for the server's attention to detail.\n\nMy breakfast was delivered by a different server and was sat down in front of me and for a brief second I thought I was going to have to make a mental note to give them one star off for forgetting my milk. When lo and behold two seconds later comes my waitress with a glass of milk. Great save on their part!\n\nThe food itself was really good the pancakes were light and fluffy, the eggs were cooked to perfection, and they were absolutely right on those link sausages ... they were the bomb diggity. The staff was really good about cruising by every once in a while and refilling my coffee and asking how things were without being overbearing. Honestly, it  felt like I was at a friend's house rather than a restaurant.\n\nThe bottom line? If you are ever out in Vegas and don't want to have to navigate through a horde of drunk people, obnoxious teenagers, or Keno players to get to your breakfast, you really have to go to The Egg & I. You won't regret it!","date":"2017-07-03 16:31:51"}

The banana bread muffin was still fresh and moist. It was so delicious. I highly recommend choosing the banana bread muffin over toast. We ordered seasoned potatoes with our omelettes.

Every time I come to Vegas I make sure to make a stop here and enjoy the banana nut muffin that tastes like heaven! The staff is always friendly and they place a newspaper style menu for you to look at. If you say it's your first time, most waitresses will bring you complimentary banana muffins for your table. But don't worry if they don't because most breakfast plates either come with toast or muffin..... Please go for the banana nut muffin!!! It's that good! For food I recommend the works skillet or any of their omelettes. They also have Hawaiian style food, which I haven't had the chance to try. The wait can go fast although it might take longer for larger groups. Parking can be a hassle during weekends. This restaurant will beat any overprice buffets on the strip, it's well worth it to go out of the strip for the food.

It is so delicious it is better than a desert. We also ordered the chicken fried steak and chorizo scramble. Everything was delicious. We ordered their potatoes one morning and their fresh fruit the other. Their fresh fruit is wonderfully cut up slices of watermelon and pineapple and other melons. Not the yucky, cheap, cut up fruit that's been sitting there for days.\nTheir breakfast potatoes are all so delicious. The best way we can describe them is they are  very seasoned bite-size french fries. sooooo goood!\nI guess it's a blessing in disguise The Egg & I is located in Las Vegas and we live in San Diego.

Outside was fine, and that's where we ended up. The outside patio was hot due to the weather, but they had some machines that automatically blew out cold must which helped a little. OSCAR- (woot woot!) our server, was absolutely AMAZING and provided exceptional customer service, making out group feel very welcome. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us some great suggestions for breakfast and lunch. Our entire party was beyond satisfied with the service, friendliness, and quick arrival of our food. Oscar provided us with the best banana nut muffins, which were served warm with butter. I had the breakfast burger with a fried egg on top, a side of delicious seasoned fries. They also serve stuffed French toast, and you have the option of getting half country potatoes and fruit, instead of full order of one or the other.

The steak is smothered in a flavorful white gravy. The portions are large so you can always take some food home for later\n\nThe service is great also. Our order came fast and easy.

Coffee wasn't great, but drinkable (similar to hotel lobby coffee). My pancake was not very fluffy, too dense. I ordered it with fresh strawberries which were cooked into it, but I would have preferred them raw on top. My boyfriend's skillet (the one with sausage and ham) was ok and was probably the best thing I tried there. His mother's bacon and cheese omelette was not very good and she ate less than half. The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over. I thought homefries were supposed to be seasoned with salt, pepper, onions and green peppers... The one good thing about this place was the wait time. 10 minutes for a party of four on a Sunday morning.","date":"2014-04-14 00:15:43"}

They put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. It was tolerable.\n\nService was decent but not over the top. They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.\n\nBreakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.\n\nBF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.\n\nYou pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way.

An IV, close... Breakfast.  The Egg & I is not to far off the strip, only about a mile depending on where you stay.  We took the back roads from Caesars and our ETA was about 5 minutes. \n\nThe coolest thing is their \"happy egg, sad egg\" stand at the edge of the table.  Whenever you need something like a drink refill, or if you have a problem with anything, just flip the egg from the happy black face to the sad yellow face.  We tested this unique method of customer service and within seconds we had our waitress back at the table asking if we needed anything.  Even without flipping the egg the waitress was very attentive.\n\nAfter you get your drinks the waitress will bring you a fresh baked banana nut muffin.  My buddy thought he was flirting with the waitress, and they totally were, so he made us all thank him graciously for the 2 muffins.  Then after 30 seconds of looking around, you realize everyone gets a muffin.  *Sad egg face Jordan, sorry :^(   But the muffin is warm and delicious.  \n\nWe had a party of 4 and we all got something different and it was all great.  I got chicken fried steak covered in gravy atop a mound of ranch potatoes with 3 fried eggs on top, and the best part about it was... they CUT it up for you!  This is when I found out I am lazy because you know you're lazy when you get excited about your food coming pre-cut.  The chicken breast was moist and the outside was perfectly crisp, and with every bite the batter unleashed a flurry of flavor.  Mouth watering.  The hype about their ranch potatoes is true.  They are really good and live up to the expectations other yelpers have set fourth.  I haven't had anything quite like them ever before.  My plate also came with a side of fresh seasonal fruit and a biscuit for gravy dunking. \n\nThe rest of the gang ordered: eggs benedict, the breakfast burrito, and a plain jane 2-egg breakfast with bacon.  All of which was worth the wait on a Sunday morning.\n\n5-Stars for the overall experience.  The waitress was cute and friendly even if she didn't give Jordan a muffin because he was \"special,\" their happy egg \/ sad egg system works well when you need something in a pinch, the superior quality of the food and the prices are great especially after losing a couple G's at the tables in Vegas.","date":"2011-08-19 21:38:35"}

Perfectly cooked eggs with the right amount of cheese and sausage. The French toast was done just right as well. So, I suppose it really depends on what you have here and what your tastes are.

Its not like its from a can or anything, its shredded ham and the flavor is different then what I believe Hash should taste like  The Banana Nut muffin was pretty good, but again I have had better.  The servers are nice and the place is adorable.  \n\nHowever if you want your Socks knocked of for breakfast go to the Hash House A Go Go, its a little further West up Sahara and on the right.  That place has the best breakfast I have ever had.\nOverall I must say Egg & I is a good place.  A  decent breakfast, however for egg critiques take a look at the pictures, unless you order an eggs Benny they over cook most of there eggs.","date":"2012-01-23 15:54:19"}

One is yellow, the other is black, and this means that your server can tell at a glance whether you need her for anything.  Every restaurant should employ a similar device.  \n\nAmanda was our waitress.  Yes, the Carnivore still uses the words waitress and waiter.  He also will not apologize for this, or stop doing it.

I appreciate the choices in coffee creamers and the carafe being left of the table, which saves the hassle of tracking down a server for a refill when you've got a small cup o' joe. Good coffee, but I come here for the eggs. \n\nI ordered the hash, but our table also ordered a pancake plate and a waffle works. The waffles look light and crisp, the pancakes are fluffy and have a variety of fillings (but I think we got charged a different-than-base-price for these, so ask or watch out? Our server suggested something after we handed over the menus), and the crispy little home fried potatoes are so tasty! (I got a half serving of these, half serving of fruit--which is plenty of both!) My hash was homemade and nothing like that cubed canned corned beef hash, but it was pretty salty for my tastes. My eggs came out EGGsactly right and were mouthwateringly delicious for something so simple--eggs. My fiance asked for tomatoes in his scrambled eggs, and those were extra too, and we weren't informed of that\/how much until we saw it on the check (the pancake chocolate chips and the tomatoes somehow managed to be about $5, so I don't know how that stacks up, but it peeved me a bit).\n\nIf they ask you if you want toast or the banana muffin, DO NOT GET TOAST. GET THE DANG MUFFIN. It is sooooo good. It doesn't look like anything special, mostly because it's flat on top and served upside down, but it's soft and moist and tasty and warm and goodness gracious, so amazing. If you're counting calories, #1 you're in the wrong place, #2 put butter on it anyway.\n\nThe little eggy signs are so helpful for when you need to track down your server--a great idea instead of trying to get someone's attention in the (can be) noisy atmosphere. \n\nThis place is fantastic, but I pulled a star because the server forgot a side order for half the meal and didn't notify us of the upcharges on the items at time of order and after suggesting (i.e. we order regular pancakes, he suggests blueberry or chocolate chip, but doesn't mention they cost extra) after taking the menus so we couldn't see ourselves. I know some things are extra, but how much sometimes influences people's decisions--knowing if it was $0.50 versus $2.00 would have made that difference, for example. Overall, will DEFINITELY come again.","date":"2016-08-12 02:18:25"}

Like all popular brunch spots, the lines are usually out the door - literally. So if you're visiting Vegas in the summer heat, keep in mind that you may be cooking for awhile.\n\nIf you check-in, you get one of their AMAZING banana nut muffins on the house! They're almost the size of a Costco muffin, so be careful not to fill up too much if you plan to enjoy their menu items (although it's easier said than done when it pairs so well with their house coffee).\n\nTheir menu is filled with enticing options - both savory and sweet. If you're like me, and literally groan in pain from indecision, you should persuade\/harangue\/guilt\/extort your friends to split a 3rd entree! I ended up getting the \"blackened prime rib benny\" ($14.25), which is an eggs benedict with prime rib, bell peppers, and spinach over a grilled croissant.  Like most of their savory dishes, it comes with their famous \"habla diablo\" seasoned potatoes, which resembles a creole-seasoning, but tastes fantastic and every serving can feed a small family of four! The eggs benedict itself was decent, though not eye-popping like their potatoes or muffins.\n\nThe pancakes (diced apples and cinnamon, 3 stack for $8.25) and french toasts (Hawaiian $8.99) that I forced my friends to get are huge, fluffy, and satisfyingly filling. For the apple and cinnamon pancakes, they put the cooked apples on the side, which is great if you don't want to be at the mercy of the restaurant's preferences.\n\nOn top of the reasonably-priced food and gigantic portions, the service is fantastic, and the staff is very friendly! If you get seated on the patio during the hot summers, the misters do a pretty decent job of keeping you cool, and the staff ensures that your cups will always be filled with water.","date":"2018-07-22 12:12:30"}

I don't think we ever used it, but I had looked it up on Yelp last year, and remembered it had good reviews.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, 4\/2\/11. While eating a breakfast of homemade blueberry waffles and chillin on the patio, Lawrence T. was telling me all about how much he loved breakfast foods - all kinds. I was trying to figure out where we were would eat before we headed off to The Adventure Dome later during the day (we ended up not going.) I was bummed when he said breakfast foods were where his heart was, because it's my least favorite meal of the day. \n\nAround 2 PM, after driving around and me not remembering the names or addresses of the places that I wanted to try on the west side (where he lives) I spotted \"Egg & I.\" Despite the fact I'm not into breakfast, I decided to suck it up and offer this place as an option because Lawrence had told me he liked breakfast so much. It helped that I vaguely remembered that it had good reviews here on Yelp. \n\nUpon walking in, you get hit in the face with the \"breakfast\" restaurant smell. You know what I'm talking about. We were seated immediately and took it all in. Lawrence was all into the fact they had soccer on their tv and that they had a zillion choices on their menu. Despite the extensive choices, not too long after sitting down, we ordered. I got the tortilla soup and house salad with ranch, and Lawrence got some omelet and fruit... and was mistakenly given a humongous side of the most delicious skinny fries ever (the problem was quickly remedied by a pregnant lady who worked there bringing him the fruit he actually ordered.) \n\nThe tortilla soup, while not the type I'm used to was SO good, I could not stop eating it. The house salad rocked, especially with the sprouts on top, and the ranch dressing was on par with that of The Mad Onion (aka DELICIOUS!) I didn't try any of Lawrence's fruit or omelet, but the few fries I stole off of his plate were the best fries I'd ever tasted. Yeah, they're that good. \n\nI have to agree with Bonnie G.'s statement that, \"You know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.\"  Lawrence kept eating his fries, while saying he should stop because he was tired of fried foods... but they were too tempting, even when blanketed by napkins on top to hide them from view, hehe.  I was so full toward the end of the meal, but my salad was so good, it was hard to finally push the remainder away.  \n\nFor our meals + coffee + $5 tip, it came out to $27 and some change. We both confided over our meal that we weren't sure about how good this place would be when we pulled up to the place, but after trying the food, it was super bomb.","date":"2011-04-03 17:05:57"}

Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. \n\nThe Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.\n\nThe Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls\n\nThe menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.    \n\nThe omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.\n\nTo summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...","date":"2015-12-13 22:17:44"}

So when a friend recommended trying this place, I was down to give it a try.  I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed!  I like how they give you a carafe of coffee when you order a cup (like IHOP) so you don't have to constantly wait to get refilled.  Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.\n\nAs far as the food, it also met my expectations.  I decided to try the egg-ceptional omelet (has bacon, mushrooms, ham, peppers, onions and sour cream) and not only was it delicious, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  I wanted to try the pancakes as well but I couldn't get it as a side so i tried the banana nut muffin that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but I'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.  \n\nThe overall price was reasonable and I prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the Egg and I is one of the best breakfast places around Vegas.

Sort of an off, slightly grainy texture, no lemon to cut the richness, just unappetizing.

The hostess seated us that had the tip still on the table and I thought that maybe she didn't see so I let her know oh the tip is still on the table and she had a bit of an attitude while telling me the server would grab it. The server, Amanda, came over to us and greeted us and we told her what happened. I wasn't that upset but I just thought it was kind of ridiculous. Anyways our server was really great! Bubbly and cute and super friendly. She even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! I love that! I guess it's company policy they leave the tip on the table due to bussers stealing tips. \n\nSo on to the food. I got what I always do, it's just a platter with potatoes sausage toast and eggs and it's always delicious. My brother got banana but French toast and Biola got regular French toast and it was fricking fantastic.  \n\nOnce again I'd just like to say how amazing our server was! Thanks Amanda!

We couldn't get enough!\n\nBesides the amazing food, there's always great service! I love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. None of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. We flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (Note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nWe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: John (I think he's new), Thaynara (sp?), and Erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. They were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nSo, the FOOD. Amazing. I'm not a breakfast person. Usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and I'm kind of picky, I know. So why did I go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? Because they know how to cook them! Between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! Not that I doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal I had was executed to perfection. Eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. Just right, every time.\n\nOut of the six things we ordered over our three visits, I got the coffee every time. It was piping hot and delicious, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... They bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. You've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (They had caramel and french vanilla, and I thinkkkk the Irish cream flavor too.) \n\nThey have some awesome works potatoes (I have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. Side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1\/2 fruit, 1\/2 potatoes, as my fiance and I did a couple of times. The fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nThey also have these TO-DIE-FOR banana nut muffins. These muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! Utterly delectable--I definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nWe've tried the corned beef hash (no canned meat products here!) and the country fried steak as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. The biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and I like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. We also tried the works omelet and Brad's scramble. There is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\nI did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. We were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nSide note the second: The decor is really cute! It looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that delicious banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nRecap: Everything is delicious, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. Will definitely return and recommend. :D","date":"2014-06-20 03:45:52"}

For me, I can't differentiate the best of the best for this staple American cuisine. In any event, came to this popular locals' spot in LV. I tried the strawberry filled French toast with bacon and scrambled eggs. I also tried a free banana nut muffin (it's free with Yelp check-in). The French toast was overbearingly sweet. The French toast on it's own without the strawberry madness was moist and fluffy; however, the strawberry filling along with the strawberry topping and the whip cream really overdid it. It was hard for me to finish.\n\nThe eggs and bacon were standard fare. Nothing to note. I tried some of my buddy's chicken fried steak. Again, decent seasoning, but tasted a bit too heavy for my liking. \n\nWhat stood out for me was the banana nut muffin. It was moist and the muffin top was crispy. Even better that it was free. I liked how it didn't have too many walnuts in it. Nice balance between breading and nuts.\n\nService was fast and courteous.

The Egg and I came up on the radar and we took a 10 min 2 mile ride to check it out. From start to finish the service and atmosphere were five star non pretentious par excellent or as they might say Eggs Cellent.  \nOur sever Lacey made excellent recommended dishes and her personal favorite. We shared two plates to get the best foodie experience we could in one trip. .\nBreakdown. The Mexican omelette was awesome. Plenty of distinct flavors and great size plate. Cheesy and little bit of a bite of spice  We had the home potatoes which were made to perfection with hot insides and crispy outside. This was accomplished by making the potatoes very small bites almost hash size.they offered all the condiments at our table with great hot sauces. The second dish wasn't my favorite but my friend loved which was the Stuffed French toast. All the ingredients we're good and the French toast itself was very good but for me it was too much in each Bite the flavors just were not distinct enough for me. We choose the fruit substitute on this plate and was surprised how much fresh fruit they gave on one plate. \nNow the best part of this place. Reviews plenty. Write ups plenty as well. But.  The best part aside from the food was the people. Lacey was phenomenal came by like 10 times. Lino the other service person at our table was the best came by and verified with us like 10 times as well and that wasn't where it stopped. The other support staff also asked us a few times if we needed anything.  Hard to find that kind of service anywhere and they all did it with a smile.  \nSide note.  Coffee was left in carafe at table so no need to waive anyone down though you probably wouldn't need to with the service as good as it was here. \nLast I highly recommend this place. The price was too good to be true for this food and service combo. Thanks Lacey and Lino and the whole staff there at Egg and I.

The veggie omelette had a generous amount of chopped veggies inside and they melt jack and cheddar cheese over the top. The meal is served with toast or their famous banana nut muffin and the muffin is light and packed with flavor. I was very hungry today but I left very full and satisfied.

It's somewhat of an odd array, but you can't go wrong. \n\nThe restaurant is located in an isolate shopping plaza with plenty of parking. Wait times are long; I suggest you plan for an hour of that (during peak times), with limited seating, so you may have to stand outside with the overflow.

Two tables that were seated after us received their food before we did. We ended up waiting a really long time just for two entrees. But we brushed it off considering there could be many factors at play.\n\nThe Classic had three slices of bacon that resembled rubber. They were not crispy at all. I didn't like the seasoning of Hablo Diablo potatoes as I felt the seasoning was overbearingly strong. I felt like there was hardly any meat and a WHOLE lot of potatoes. \n\nWe drank all our water and tried to get our waitress's attention. After five minutes or so, I flipped the egg to yellow (meaning we would like attention). Our waitress glanced at our table and proceeded to walk away. Another waitress promptly flipped it back to black and asked what we needed. When I said we needed a refill she said okay and proceeded to chat with the table next to us. She never bothered to grab our waters. Finally, our waitress asked what it was that we needed earlier and finally got us water. \n\nAlso guess what?

It was so light, fuffy, yet sticky, we could have easily eaten a full loaf just the two of us.  We didnt realize you can order the full lf until a plate was served near us... \n\nTheir menu (made to look like the morning paper - clever concept!) offered an abundant options that it could be overwhelming.\n\nThey dropped our veggie eggs benedict, so they had to fire it again... the spinach was left raw and piled in top of the itty bitty english muffin and slivers of avocados.  We love spinach, but the proportions were off - would have liked a slightly sauteed spinach or place a smaller portion of raw leaves.\n\nOur other orders were a classic over easy eggs with spicy seasoned potatoes with an xtra side of waffles.  Since they had to re-fire the eggs benedict, the egg was luke warm and waffles were not as golden crispy as we liked.\n\nWhoever made our batch of coffee added too much water as it was missing that needed caffeine perk.  Im sensitive to caffeine and even I thought it was too weak.  \n\nWe love the vibe of this breakfast spot, so hopefully, it will be a win next time.","date":"2017-09-04 16:33:06"}

If you are unhappy you can switch it to the sad face but if you look around tables are pretty satisfied. \n\nFood: 4 stars- food is decent but nothing special. Wide selection of almost any breakfast dish you can think of. Most dishes come with your choice of eggs and potatoes.

The banana nut muffins are soft delicious fluffy and warm, served to you before your main course comes. The portions are well sized, prices wern't outrageous, but the waitress forgot my friend's toast. I had a crepe, which comes with ranch potatoes.

Yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  And how much do you want to eat every single morning?  Don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an \"I live to bingo\" sweater?\n\nIf you do, take a short drive down W. Sahara Ave to Egg and I.  You will not be disappointed.  Inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, Egg and I provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of The Strip.\n\nBy now you're probably wondering what \"Egg\" looks like.  Well, Egg looks kind of like Humpty Dumpty, and \"I\" looks just like \"Egg.\"  Just look on their website.  Might as well call the whole place \"2 Eggs,\" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  \n\nWe came in around 9:30 am on Saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  We got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  We had just gotten into town, and I was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  You'd better believe I took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  Even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.\n\nWe couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  Also, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.\n\nThere was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  The Ultimate Skillet is not for the weak...that much I know.  A generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a Cajun flavor to it.  Paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and delicious.  The Ultimate Skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions and cheese.  The skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  WOW.  \n\nWe also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3\/4 of the skillet, I wasn't hankering for a pancake.  I did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  I was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  On any other day, I can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the Ultimate Skillet proved to be a bit much.  Order at your own risk.  That's a LOT of food for $9.95.\n\nGreat breakfast in a quaint setting?  I will be sure to make it my regular Vegas breakfast destination.","date":"2010-11-05 23:07:09"}

My husband ordered a ham & cheese omelet. The eggs tasted watery and you couldn't even taste the meat. The Diablo potatoes were over seasoned but the most decent tasting thing on our table. The apple juice tasted like it was dispensed from a moldy dispenser, it has a funk to it. I ordered French toast, and even that was tasteless! We will never eat here again...oh and my husband felt so sick after eating he threw up.

We needed a pick-me-up after a bad doctors office visit. Took 2 hours for 2 mins of doc attention so we were pretty annoyed. This lifted our spirits, because we both love breakfast foods. We drove a few miles to go to Egg and I simply because I wanted to try it based on the great Yelp reviews.\nWe were not disappointed. Everything was great for my first time ever eating here.\nWe walked in at 1215 and were immediately seated on a Thursday lunch hour. There were plenty of tables inside and out, and since it was a sunny calm day we decided it'd be nice to get out and get a little sun after being stuck in the doc office.\nI went with the \"This Little Piggy\" omelet and it was just the way I like it. Lots of egg, lots of cheese, and plenty of meats. It comes with chopped up bacon, chopped up sausage, and chopped up chunks of ham, folded in half and smothered with about a half pound of cheese!!!! Also comes with the country potatoes which I was expecting to be orgasmic based on reviews, but let me down just a little bit. Don't get me wrong they were really good, but maybe my batch just wasn't quite cooked long enough and they were a little softer than I like em. Also I got the banana nut muffin with my meal, (this thing WAS OUT-friggen-STANDING) and she brought it out before the meal, which I thought to be a little strange. But i was really hungry so it was just fine with me.\nMy honey got a breakfast burrito and she said it was really good, looked to me like it had a ton of peppers, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she enjoyed it. Had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all, this thing was pretty big and also came with the country potatoes.\nThis was a great breakfast experience and can understand how this place can get pretty busy at times. We were very happy with the food and mostly happy with the service, she was just a little slow a couple times and we were only there for about 45 minutes. i.e. forgot to get a sprite, and never really came back to ask us if we needed anything after our food was brought out and if it was cooked ok. After she brought the check we decided to get a refill to go since the sprite was $2.50 and brought late and we waited for a few minutes to see her but never did. In the end it worked out, when we paid we asked the cashier if she could help us in getting the to-go refill and she politely went and took care of that for us with a smile. :)\nThanks Egg and I, we will be back for sure!","date":"2011-04-15 20:32:29"}

This place showed up in my search results.  It had over 1,100 reviews and nearly a 5 star rating.  Obviously, I had to try it.  My companions were a bit skeptical upon arriving.  However, after my first visit, I was thoroughly impressed.  The waitress and staff were very attentive.  And the food?  It was incredible!  I got the Bacon and Sliced Avocado omelet with fruit, one companion got the Crazy Chicken omelet and another got the Sunrise Mountain.  The amount of avocado in our omelets was awesome.  My one companion complained to me that it was too much avocado, but she's nuts.  There is no such thing as too much avocado.  And my other companion, loved, loved, loved the Sunrise Mountain so much that he got it the 2nd morning were went.  Yes, that's right, we went 2 mornings in a row.  My 2nd morning, I got the Chili Rellenos omelet (which was more amazing than the bacon one [I know!]), and my other companion got the Seasoned Center Cut NY Steak.  And again, it was incredible!  And the staff again exceeded our expectations.  The manager (sorry, I cant remember her name, but she's curly haired, blonde and very beautiful...hey, I was enthralled with food in front of me, but she's amazing! EDIT: her name is Abby...yes, I did go back this morning) brought out the steak and asked my companion to cut into it to see if was to her doneness preference because other steaks were coming out a little rarer than preferred.  Upon doing so, and finding it was in fact a little too rare, it was gladly taken back and finished to perfection.  \n\nAll this to say that I am preparing myself to go the gym to work up a monster appetite so that we can go this morning for the third day in a row and enjoy another EGGMAZING (sorry, couldn't help myself) breakfast! God, I wish this place was in NJ.  FYI, I took a menu with their knowledge and explained to them that I am going try and replicate for my own personal satisfaction.","date":"2018-01-19 15:29:26"}

Made the first mistake while serving drinks (15minutes after we got sat) and it just never got better. We eat here or more often at Egg Works and normally it's amazing or at minimum pretty good so that made today so much worse. The manager made a good effort but one of our party who didn't eat so a little offended by the coupons she gave us for the problems. Buy one get one half off. I didn't have that much of a problem with them but she thought that was kind of rude. Service bad, food substandard, orders incomplete and you offer a bogo?

Our server, Amanda, was so warm and welcoming and everyone else who worked there was just bustling with positive energy and good vibes all around. Servings are good for 2. There was just a bit of a wait as the line was out the door when we got there but they were quick to seat people.

There was a lot of people waiting but the wait was probably less than 10 mins. Love the fact that they use an app system and you get a text of your wait time and your table is ready.\n\nService was GREAT!! \n\nThis time around my food was a bit on the salty side but still great!  As always, The banana nut muffin is a must have. OJ had a bit too much pulp as my straw had a tough time sucking it up. Plus it was not cold. Also I wish they served a single stack pancake that was not $5 but then again it was in the shape of a micky mouse and I'm pretty sure it was off the children's menu\n\nQuick tip! Save $5 when you buy 2 entrees if you go get the VEGAS coupon book at miracle mile. I'm not sure if it's at the  other shops but it's free and will save you some $$$","date":"2017-05-23 08:49:30"}

The menus are quite charming as they look like your local newspaper and there are many delicious options. I ended up ordering Grandma's Biscuits & Gravy with scrambled eggs, home fries, sausage patties and a banana nut muffin. The muffin was soft and warm; slather some butter and it was great. I really enjoyed the gravy on the biscuits and the home fries, where are very well seasoned. The rest of my party got a ham and bacon omelette with home fries and a blueberry muffin, along with a chicken salad sandwich on rye bread with cranberries and walnuts. All three of us ended up eating half the plates so we have some food to go with us on the 4 1\/2 hour trip back home. \nOverall, great food, nice service and reasonable prices.

Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.\n\nThe Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.\n\nThen there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.\n\nThe Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.\n\nI really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.\n\nThe service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast.

The most delicious banana nut muffin I have ever had the pleasure of eating! I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who suggest that when dining here with company it would be wise to split dishes as the portion sizes are very generous! I ordered the Hobo scramble which was a special and not available on the regular menu. I am sucker for a scramble however the superior quality of the muffin has convinced me to sample the sweeter items (waffles) on the menu the next time I visit this place. Lots of people rave about the potatoes and I have to say that they were not what I personally am looking for in a potato. They are covered in seasoning and I just prefer a simpler potato flavor. The coffee was great and I cannot say that about many places! Here it is a good strength with a good flavor and it comes in cute mug with two happy eggs on it! Probably my favorite thing about this place is the little egg sign at your table that you can flip from happy to sad when you are in need of something. It beats having to pay close attention to flag down your waiter whenever they walk by. On our visit we didn't even have to use it because the service was so good!","date":"2011-09-12 05:33:18"}

Anything you get here will be a party in your mouth.\n\nAlthough it's off the Strip, it's definitely worth a try.","date":"2009-01-24 09:23:50"}

I had no idea where to go or what to eat. I came to Yelp like I normally do. Mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and I packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nWhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. I sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that I could park. As soon as she walked in, she called me. She said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. Nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. So, I walked in to wait.\n\nUpon entering, I was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. I just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. Surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nThe place is really small and packed to capacity, so I was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. We had plenty space.\n\nThe server came around fast to take our drink order. She was quick to bring our drinks back too. She asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"No, we're looking at Yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" I did ask about the stuff French Toast dish that someone shared on Yelp. She smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. Then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nAs soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. When she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. We went ahead and ordered. It totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. The waitress said, \"You were on Yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" I was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nShe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. I don't even like banana nut muffins but I took it anyways because it was free. I took a bite of it and fell in love. It was so warm and yummy lol. My friend got emotional lol. She said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. They were just delicious.\n\nAbout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. I order the Stuffed French Toast with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. It also came with seasoned potatoes. It looked incredible. My friend ordered the 2 pork chops that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the seasoned potatoes. Her's looked delicious too.\n\nI LOVE potatoes so I ate those first. I put ketchup all over them and had a ball. My friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. I put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nNext, I started in on my French Toast sandwiches. I didn't like the sandwiches. The sausages, eggs and cheese didn't have much flavor. I thought I made a big mistake. Being that I'm so smart, I thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the French toast and season the filling myself. I did, and it was 90% better. I ate the filling separately, and ever so often, I would dip the French Toast in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nMy friend said that the pork chops were Just okay. They were really thin, for sure. I don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. I wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and I took a bite of hers. They tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. She was right. They were just okay. She did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nThe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. I'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nThe service was like a 3\/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. I asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. I guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. I didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and I didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nBut also, I took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once I had actually finished it. It took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. We just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. When she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. She came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. We were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. I'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nAlthough I'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, I probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.","date":"2015-11-30 23:01:58"}

If you are waiting in line, check out their menu cause they have a LOT of choices. \n\n3. Wear a sweater\/sweatshirt - I know were in Vegas but the place was blasting the AC. Even our waitress had a sweatshirt on. \n\n4. Order a banana bread muffin, its moist and fresh and a great snack. I ordered one after our meal because I was stuffed from my plate \n\n5. If you know you can't eat a whole plate of food, get the HALF order. Of course our waitress told us AFTER we finished. \n\n6. The pancakes were the best part of my meal - order them!

We've been here several times over the years and generally been happy.

Like bread for French toast, one of their more popular items should always be in stock. \n\nBut what really surprised us is how cheap they've gotten and lazy with inferior ingredients. Hash-browns were those frozen oval patties you buy at Sams or Costco in bulk. Tasteless and cheap. How hard is it for a breakfast joint to make real hash browns? My son ordered country potatoes and they too were from frozen and preseasons. They same kind you can buy at any grocery store. \n\nI asked for a blueberry muffin but was told those were also store bought. The waitress suggested the banana muffin which they do make which was very good. \n\nMy wife ordered maple bacon French toast which seemed to be made of a muffin batter. That doesn't really work for French toast as it's heavy and doesn't get crisp or toasted at all. The whipped maple bacon stuff tasted of old rancid grease, it was lumpy and everyone of us who tasted it said it seemed like diary gone bad like lumpy old milk! Three of us were sick to our stomachs all morning. \n\nHey but at least service was slow and it was extremely noisy to the point that I had to go outside to escape the noise. \n\nI doubt we'll ever be back.

I've been hearing about how great their banana nut muffin and it truly does live up to the hype. It was light and fluffy and the banana flavor was subtle. \n\nThe corned beef hash comes with ranch potatoes (think Tommys style fries with that red seasoning only diced up), eggs, and a side of watermelon and pineapple. The hash was served under scrambled eggs in a skillet. The ranch potatoes were crisp and flavorful. I just wish the hash was a bit crispier. Since the hash was made with a mixture of potatoes, the texture remained soft and did not create any contrast with the scrambled eggs. It had good flavor though. \n\nLastly, the customer service is top notch. All the waitresses were happy to help and near the end of brunch, the owner\/manager came over just to chit chat, which I appreciated.","date":"2011-04-13 02:32:33"}

It was ALL salted so heavily that we couldn't finish anything.  The potatoes were coated with an orange, seasoned salt, the gravy could have easily floated a ship. My two scrambled eggs, which HAD to actually be four because they covered half the huge place, were browned and chewy.

The Black egg means everything is fine; the yellow egg means we need something:  I did a test run (didn't need anything) and they were on us immediately!

Green Chili Hash was phenomenal!  Rice and beans and sourdough toast a perfect compliment.  Better half had the stuffed French toast with strawberries and cream cheese.

I don't love anything about it. Except when I visit the Egg & I. And let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.\n\nI can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...\n\nSuper awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast\/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters\/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! I've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no complaints. I've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy.

If you need anything, you can flip a cardboard egg on your table from black to yellow, and someone comes within minutes to see what you need. That, plus everyone gets a table-side carafe of coffee, were huge pluses. \n\nUnfortunately the pluses didn't completely overshadow the fact that our waitress messed up both our orders. My wife's veggie omelet, hold the onions, was stuffed with onions. My Cali omelet, the special for the morning, for some reason and as egg whites. I didn't want to wait for another one, so I just ate it. It didn't have much flavor as a result. Nor did the cinnamon raisin toast my wife ordered.

Other than that, the restaurant was lacking and not worth the trip from the strip. Just FYI, these Egg & I restaurants are independent from one another as I heard the staff tell another customer.\n\nMy wife and I went on a Monday morning. The reviews said their would be lines, but we encountered none. \n\nWe got a variety of food. She got coffee, pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey ham.  I got OJ, hot tea, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and turkey sausage (they only have patties in turkey sausage).  \n\nShe said her coffee was good, the eggs were as expected, but nothing spectacular, and she liked the turkey ham. The pancakes were not cooked all the way through. She ate about 1\/3 before she got to the middle to discover the undercooking. The restaurant offered to toss them back on the griddle, but she declined as she wanted to eat my potatoes (which were very good).  They brought out a chocolate muffin to make up for it. It hasn't been eaten yet, but I suspect it's pretty decent. \n\nAs for my food, the potatoes were really good! Like really good.  Well seasoned and smaller and crispy, the way I prefer them to be. My wife liked them as well.  My turkey sausage was  undercooked and cold when served.  If you like hot tea like me, savor your first tea bag, because that's all you'll be getting for the $2.50 it costs to get hot tea. And perhaps it was my mistake for ordering biscuits and gravy; as a southern man, maybe my standards are too high. The meal was reminiscent of what you get at a Holiday Inn continental breakfast in the south. Seriously, no joke, and I feel bad about saying it like that, but it's true. The biscuits were hard and as if they were precooked and then microwaved when the dish was ordered. The gravy was ok, but nothing special. \n\nOverall, with the cost of breakfast, plus the uber there and back, it would have been just as cheap to do the Bellagio buffet and gotten better food and more options.","date":"2016-02-22 18:00:53"}

The hollandaise sauce was creamy and not too thick. The eggs were perfectly poached. Together with the Canadian bacon, everything was well balanced.

Filling was scrambled eggs, chicken, and other 'yummy-ness', tasty, great home-fries. Only $10 with lots of coffee.\nGreat portions, excellent flavor. Good comfort food. Everything that my friends ordered looked great. They loved theirs as well. \nDo yourself a favor, skip the breakfast buffets and casinos for breakfast. Go here!!!!!","date":"2015-09-23 19:10:17"}

Stopped by for a late breakfast on a Sunday before leaving Vegas. I had the biscuits and gravy with potatoes. Eggcellent! The gravy is delicious and I love the fact that our waitress offered a sample before ordering. So good we ordered gravy to go. The potatoes were flavorful too. Cool spot to enjoy breakfast or lunch while watching sports. A variety of games were shown throughout. I can see why this place stays busy. \n\nIf like me and you don't eat eggs don't let that fool you. Lots of options way beyond eggs. The customer service was good too!","date":"2018-09-24 20:13:07"}

It's a very huge portion and it tastes super good by itself but throw on some of that chipotle hot sauce and it's a winner. The side of potatoes it comes with are phenomenal super crispy and seasoned to perfection. \n\nGF ordered a sundance special omelette and loved it too. Came with the same potatoes. \n\nChecked in and got the free muffin, server actually gave us an extra one at no charge because of the wait. \n\nClean, friendly, fast and cheap and good food.

So what's the first thing I do?  Check it out on Yelp, of course!  \n\nYes, there is a wait.  But like everyone says, the line goes really quickly and I think we were seated within 15-20 minutes, which is not bad considering it was a Saturday at peak brunch time.  \n\nI loved their newspaper style menus and all the great descriptions to help decide what to order.  First thing I have to mention is the banana nut muffin.  Yes, I know everyone mentions it but it is SO worth mentioning!  It's so moist and delicious, I actually now crave the darn thing!  \n\nI ordered a corned beef hash with eggs and instead of their potatoes, I ordered rice.  The corned beef hash was okay, I like mine on the crispier side but it was still good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Not too many places can make the perfect over-medium where it's a little cooked but just enough runnyness to get some yolk without it spewing all over the plate like an over-easy.  I tried my girlfriend's potatoes and should've stuck with it.  It was almost like little bites of french fries.  SO delicious!  I'm definitely heading back there next chance I get to, until then, I shall see the banana nut muffin in my dreams...","date":"2011-03-17 02:46:31"}
