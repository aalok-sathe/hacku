I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \n\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \n\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \n\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!","date":"2017-01-14 21:30:33"}

Was thankful to get an appointment as I called two days before. The receptionist was very welcoming and friendly. So the morning after we arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel I  went to the salon for my appointment. The receptionist warmly greeted me and gave me a tour of the salon. It was alot different than salons in South Florida where it is definitely more NE vibe and this screemed California. But not in a bad way. See the tour had after you sit with your stylist you sit in a circle so you can face the other guests and chat. Than there is the changing room where you can write your positive thoughts in colored chalk. For real or am I on candid camera. \n\nAnyway I sat with the stylist told him my story needed blonde highlights and I am blonde therefore I don't go often to salons ie every 3 months. He was very quick and since everyone is a team he had help with the many tin foils. I went to the ladies room and didn\"t know where to sit next. So as I was shown where to go next I was falling asleep sitting up since I had jet lag and never went to sleep. \n\nOnce I was ready I was shown the room where they shampoo you. Only for the first time in my experience someone padded the sink with many towels and it was heavenly. The shampoo was great water not too cold and a neck massage. If I lived here I would come here every week. Now for the blow out they work as a Team and first this lovely lady started than the original stylist. Everyone was great and they had great hair. I looked fabulous when I left. \n\nLet me know when you open in South Florida!","date":"2016-12-27 02:45:46"}

However, when I went into my salon and told them what happened the very first thing I was asked was whether I was facing the mirror or away from it.  I replied I was facing away, looking outside.  The lady looked at another lady with this \"look\" on her face and basically told me I got duped.  She went on to say salons that don't let you look while they apply the product typically will try and use less product and in my case, since I couldn't feel the product on my scalp, they got away with not doing all my roots.

I started out in the San Diego salon with Salvador Rubio. He was amazing then I moved to Las Vegas and then he followed a few months later. He has been the only person cutting my hair. Having him do my hair has been transformative and has given me great advice on how to keep my hair styled and healthy. I recommend him to the highest degree. I'm sad that I had to move away but any time I'm in Las Vegas I pay him a visit.","date":"2017-10-07 05:21:33"}

They were offering complimentary blowouts during their grand opening. I scheduled my blowout after my massage at the Hard Rock's Spa. I was greeted by the gorgeous salon director, Lauren. Lauren was warm and welcoming. I was early so we had the chance to talk while I waited for my service. She was so excited to share her love of the salon and its culture with me. This salon truly is a place where they want you to walk out feeling as good as you look. Lauren gave me a tour of the salon which was immaculate, chic, and state of the art. From the individual stylists' stations to the color bar, you can feel the creative energy throughout the entire salon. It was hard to pay attention to the tour because I was distracted by Lauren's badass hair color-a rose gold that sparkled in the light. I didn't even know it was possible to create hair color that sparkled like that! I instantly knew I should have blocked out more time for more services but we had dinner reservations and my boyfriend was waiting. I was shown to my station where I met stylist Sara, another gorgeous soul. We started talking about my hair, which, at the time, was curly, wild, and blue. I mentioned my love of Mohawk braids and suddenly she was creating one as we chatted. I fell in love. I would have been happy to walk out right there but then I never would have met Sal. Sal was my stylist and every bit the professional. We discussed my hair and he politely asked about my massage at the spa. He walked me into the shampoo room, which was quiet, dim, and relaxing. I sat in the chair and Sal covered me in a plush blanket, made sure I was comfortable, and got to work. He shampooed my hair and gave me a head massage that made me forget my expensive spa massage. I would have been sad it was over if I wasn't so excited for my blowout. Sal got right to work, showing me his technique so I could try to recreate the fabulousness at home. When he finished, my hair was shiny and full of body. I looked AMAZING! Sara came back and offered to braid my hair and I happily accepted. I continued to chat with everyone and was thrilled to learn there was a KC salon in Chicago! I honestly have never had such a great time at a salon. This group loves their work and seems more like a family than coworkers. In an industry that is all about looks, this place provides an experience that is more than skin-deep. I don't write reviews for anything because I'm not easy to please and I typically don't care enough, but this salon went above and beyond. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and get color next time! Go check them out and enjoy yourself. You won't be disappointed!","date":"2016-11-19 04:21:10"}

Worth every penny! \nI am a Vegas local and have been to  most high end salons in the area. I decided to  try Kelly Cardenas in Hard Rock based  off a recommendation. \nMy appointment was on a Sunday which happens to be their champagne day. *awesome*\nI was greeted by Lauren at the front. She had me sign in on the iPad as she got me a glass of champagne. My hair stylist, Aaron, was with me by the time I entered my name. No wait! (I hate waiting for appointments at other salons).  Aaron gave me a tour of the beautiful salon and pointed out they have multiple hair dryers so two stylists can dry at once. They  also have a beautiful view of the pool area and their shampoo room is like a spa! Aaron checked my purse at the front and let me put on a robe before consulting with me on what I wanted. He gave great suggestions on what he thought I should do for the color and cut. He mixed the color in front of me while I waited at the color station. He did so many foils and was so quick! I waited under the dryer which was not too hot. I hate getting burned at other salons. Lauren checked in on me again and gave me another glass of champagne. Aaron took me into the shampoo room which is dim and quiet. The sink bowls are the first ones that don't hurt the back of my head.  He also gave me a scalp and shoulder massage. It was amazing! Another stylist came by and helped blow dry with a second blow dryer. I love that they help eachother and do everything the  same way. Most salons are full of gossip and everyone is out for themself. This was SO different! I absolutely loved my color, cut and beautiful curls he gave me. He reccomended trial sizes of the new shampoo and conditioner for my now blonde hair. Lauren helped me check out and was again so personable. I  made another appointment with Aaron and can't wait to go back. What a perfect salon! \nBest salon experience out there! Hands down!
