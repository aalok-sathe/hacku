The service was terrific, the food was above-par for a typical bar, the prices were fairly reasonable although a tad bit upscale and there was a vast amount of seating that would allow you to watch virtually any game in comfort.\n\nNow other than the seating, pretty much everything else has changed.   The last two times I've been here the service was lousy, downright apathetic, there seemed to be no shortage of servers and wait-staff in the place but they seemingly vanished at times without a trace.    \n\n\nNow the worst part.     The menu was overhauled almost entirely.  Previously it was filled with good stuff, at reasonable prices.    What they've managed to do at Fox Sports Grill in terms of an amazingly epic  transformation is to completely destroy the menu, drop the quality of the food tremendously and yet somehow RAISE the prices.\n\nNow you're stuck with overpriced, dry and unappetizing sliders, food that tastes of dirty oil and more.       Their pizzas in the past were fantastic, the crap they're serving up nowadays reminds me more of generic frozen-food aisle grocery store pizza(not even Digiorno).     So the food tastes awful, but they've had the audacity to raises the prices.\n\nNow you're sitting there, paying way above-par prices for sub-par food.   WTF man?      This place used to be fantastic but evidently some genius decided that they could make more profit by offering crappier quality at higher prices.      I'm not buying it.      There's too much competition, too many other options for this sort of nonsense.         \n\n  I can head to Zipps down the road, The Arena(yeah, its standard bar food but it won't cost an arm and leg) or best of all, Casey Jones Grill where I can pay less and somehow get much better food and service.\n\n\nBottomline, this place has jumped the shark completely.    Whatever they had going right for them is pretty much gone.     Its a shame, because this used to be a fave of mine but after what I've witnessed there, its not worth spending money or time at anymore.","date":"2010-11-22 07:31:43"}

At one point we had to get up and walk across the restaurant to get our watiress's attention just to refill our water glass. When we finally did get our food, it was bland and uninspired. Started with the wings, they were overcooked and too chewy. They only gave us one little cup of ranch for 8 wings and when we asked for more they said they had to charge us. I got the burger and it was ok but I have had much better at even fast food restaurants. My girlfriend got some salad that was dry, so to cover that up they drenched it in dressing. It was inedible, we sent it back. The best part about that is they still tried to charge us for it on the bill. We had to argue for about 20 min to get it off. First with the waitress, then the asst manager, and finally the general manager. Was charging us $11 for a salad we had two bites of really worth ruining a customer's experience? I guess to this establishment it is. The main reason we went was to watch a game and I was so turned off with them trying to nickel and dime us, I left in the third quarter and went to the zipp's up the street.
